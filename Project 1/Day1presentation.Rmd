# Introduction
This analysis explores the hypothesis that the GDP of a country influences the number of F1 (student) and H1B (work) visas issued over time. We will examine data from multiple countries in different continents to identify trends between economic performance and visa issuances.

# Hypothesis
Higher GDP correlates with an increased number of F1 and H1B visas issued over time. Conversely, countries with lower GDP growth may experience fewer visas being granted.
