# Initial Problem: 
**Does a higher GDP correlate with greater issuance of F1 and H1B visas?**

# Follow-ups
Additionally, we can explore potential secondary questions, such as:

- **How do presidential terms relate to the number of visa issuances?**

- **What policies drive fluctuations in F1 and H1B visa approvals?**
