WASHINGTON -- The biggest immigration battle of the year is coming to a head this month, but the focus isn't on fences, farm workers or food stamps. Instead, it's on computer programs and the people who write them. For the past year, American high-tech companies have been working with Congress to expand an 8-year-old program that brings in 65,000 foreign professionals each year.
The companies want the limit raised to 115,000. Because the visas are good for up to six years, the increase would mean that -- under this program alone -- as many as 690,000 foreign workers eventually could be employed in the United States at any given time. The lobbying has continued at a time when some of these companies have laid off American workers or imposed hiring freezes.
Last month, Intel, one of the driving forces behind the program's expansion, said it would cut 3,000 positions because of slow computer sales. One crucial question is at the center of the upcoming congressional vote: Should lawmakers add protections to help American programmers and engineers who compete for these coveted jobs? Most of the foreign workers come from India and China, where they likely earned about $2,500 a year.
In the United States, they stand to make almost 15 times that amount. U.S. employers say safeguards aren't needed.
They say they hire foreign workers only when they can't find skilled Americans to do the job. "If we had rampant problems with the program, I probably wouldn't even be proposing an increase," said Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., chairman of the Senate immigration subcommittee and the high-tech industry's champion on this issue. "We don't have problems with the program, because we have very responsible employers who are truly playing by the rules." But the rules in this high-stakes game are extraordinarily loose: [] Some of the top users of the program, which requires an H-1B visa, are foreign-owned firms that don't consider hiring American engineers or programmers.
They recruit only from abroad. [] Current safeguards, designed to make sure employers can't bring in H-1B workers at low wages, don't work because "prevailing wage" figures are often misleading. [] Labor Department officials say their hands are tied and their eyes blindfolded under the current regulations.
They've asked Congress for either a meaningful oversight role or no role at all. [] The Immigration and Naturalization Service has so completely abdicated its H-1B responsibilities that it doesn't bother to check if the foreign workers go home when their visas expire. [] Many of the most active H-1B importers are temporary staffing agencies that recruit foreign workers simply to lease them to U.S. companies.
The U.S. companies like the arrangement, because they can hire for specific projects and then let workers go when the projects are over.
This lowers their overall labor costs. High-tech companies were delighted last month when the Senate passed a bill that would increase the number of guest workers without tightening the regulations. But they reacted angrily to the bill that's now moving through the House. It would require employers to attest that they at least tried to find American workers, and that they hadn't laid off anyone to make room for an H-1B worker. The regulation would add two checkoff boxes to the current one-page Labor Department form.
But some high-tech employers say that is too much.
They'd scrap the H-1B increase entirely, rather than put up with new regulations. The final shape of the law that Congress passes in the coming weeks could determine the value of tomorrow's U.S. high-tech jobs. If companies continue their growing reliance on temporary foreign workers, will these prized jobs of the 1990s retain their luster in the 21st century? Or will wages and working conditions erode as the high-tech work force fills with foreign programmers willing to work longer hours for less money? [] [] [] Saju James sits nattily attired in a double-breasted blazer in the conference room of Tata Consultancy Services in the Washington suburb of Rockville, Md. Tata is an international technology firm based in India and one of the biggest users of the H-1B program.
With its corporate cousin, Tata Infotech, it was the second-biggest recipient of H-1B visas last year at 1,128. Tata Consultancy, the larger of the cousins, has about 1,500 people working in the United States.
The programmers are paid by Tata, but they actually work under contract for some of America's biggest and best-known technology firms. James' job is to obtain their H-1B visas. Upon request, he brings out files on 13 Tata employees working in San Diego on a project with UCSD. The H-1B law requires employers to make the files available for public inspection. All 13 were top graduates of India's premier technical institutes, he said, and each had 18 months of specialized on-the-job training in India before coming to the United States. The group at UCSD is working on a multimedia project that requires many of today's "hot skills."
They are precisely the kinds of programmers in demand in today's labor market. Tata pays them an average of $35,300 a year. Although entry-level salaries in the high-tech industry fluctuate, that figure appears to be low. At a Senate hearing earlier this year, a CEO said his company gave a new car to one engineering graduate as a signing bonus.
A University of Michigan dean told of a prevailing wage of $66,851 for someone with an applications programmer degree. Yet the Tata engineers, who have equivalent degrees, make only about half that much. The H-1B program's loose regulations, which the computer industry helped shape, make the wide range in salaries possible. Employers are required to pay their H-1B workers at least the "prevailing wage," a figure drawn from salary surveys of local businesses. But employers are allowed to pick and choose from a wide range of salary surveys, including some that are outdated or flawed.
Naturally, they tend to pick the lowest prevailing wage available. The prevailing wage listed for the Tata employees at UCSD is $33,370. The source is the Economic Research Institute. An official with the institute freely admitted that its survey shows a higher prevailing wage -- $37,700. But, he said, a government survey lists a prevailing wage of $33,176. The rate is artificially low, he said, because it is based on 2-year-old data and lumps professionals with paraprofessionals. Tata's James concedes that $35,300 may seem low in today's hot job market. Especially when you're talking about people as highly skilled as the Tata engineers. But by Indian standards, $35,300 is a phenomenal salary, he said.
At home, these programmers would make about $2,500 a year. "With the money they save here, they can go back to India and build a house," he said. As James sits surrounded by bare walls in Tata's sparsely furnished office in Rockville, he wonders aloud how the main safeguards in the House bill would affect Tata. The one requiring Tata to attest that it hadn't laid off any American workers would be no problem.
Tata doesn't have any American programmers or engineers to lay off.
It simply doesn't hire American. But the requirement that companies recruit American workers could spell trouble. All of Tata's recruiting is done in India. Of the 1,500 Tata employees working in the United States, James can think of only one, a vice president, who is American. [] [] [] Tata Consultancy isn't the only H-1B user without American engineers. Tata Infotech, its corporate cousin, has about 500 employees in the United States, also under contract with U.S. firms.
About 95 percent of them are here on H-1Bs, a company official said.
Most of the rest are here on L-1 visas, which are temporary visas for support staff. Another top user of H-1Bs, Mastech Systems of Oakdale, Pa., reports that the overwhelming majority of its engineers and programmers, also on contract to U.S. technology firms, are in the United States on temporary work visas. Mastech was the single-largest H-1B user last year, with 1,689. Rep. Bruce Morrison, a Connecticut Democrat who was chairman of the House immigration subcommittee when the H-1B program was created in 1990 and takes fatherly pride in the program, says the practices of companies like Tata Consultancy, Tata Infotech and Mastech raise questions beyond immigration law -- questions of hiring discrimination. "This isn't an H-1B problem, it's a Title VII problem," he said. [] [] [] Sen. Abraham and industry representatives are fond of saying the H-1B program is "totally transparent."
Anybody can go to a workplace and see how much an H-1B worker earns.
Theoretically, this ensures they're not paid less than other workers, thereby undermining the U.S. wage structure. That may be the law, but it's not how it works. When Qualcomm's Daniel L. Sullivan, senior vice president for human resources, appeared before the House immigration subcommittee to push for an expanded H-1B program, he also said that the program was well-regulated and that the proposed employee protections were unnecessary. San Diego-based Qualcomm has 10,600 employees in the United States.
Of those, 572 -- about 5.5 percent of the company's work force -- are on temporary work visas. "Current regulations require Qualcomm and every other business to pay H-1B employees at the same rate we pay nonimmigrant personnel in the same job categories," Sullivan said, adding that he has seen "no evidence that employers are attempting to evade the prevailing wage regulation." Several weeks later, in an office at Qualcomm's headquarters, a company administrator opened an accordion file packed with information on all the company's H-1B employees. Last year, the telecommunications company brought in 122 H-1B workers.
For many, the listed prevailing wage was $33,200. The source was the Radford Survey. Steve Radford is head of the Radford Division of Aon Consulting.
He has been surveying high-tech compensation practices for 23 years.
He said the "effective" prevailing wage range for an entry-level programmer in San Diego is between $38,000 and $45,000. Qualcomm's Bill Bold, who has lobbied in Washington to expand the H-1B program, said Qualcomm pays its foreign professionals more than the prevailing wage listed on the Labor Department forms stuffed into the accordion file.
But he wouldn't say how much. He said the company "as a rule" doesn't pay less than $42,000 for entry-level programmers like the ones hired under the H-1B program and often offers a signing bonus and company stock. But he refused to disclose the actual wages of the H-1B workers.
Initially, company officials had promised to, but after weeks of delays decided against it. Without knowing the actual wages, it is impossible to determine whether Qualcomm is paying foreign workers the same as its other entry-level programmers, or if the workers are lumped at the bottom of the company's salary ladder. [] [] [] Sen. Abraham may have confidence in the way the H-1B program is being run, but the officials who run it don't. Labor Department officials complain that regulations force them to rubber-stamp H-1B applications. They can reject the applications only when they aren't completely filled out and signed, or if the forms contain information that's clearly incorrect.
Otherwise, approval comes within seven days. At the INS, spokesman Russ Bergeron said his agency's only role in the H-1B program is to count the number of visas approved and make sure it doesn't exceed the legal limit. Actually, the agency must approve each H-1B visa.
But the process is so perfunctory that it's easy to see how Bergeron could overlook it.
All the INS has to do is make sure the applicant's occupation qualifies under the program. Although employers must fill out a three-page form for the INS, only a small portion of the information is entered into a database.
Most of it remains on the application form, stored in one of four INS service centers nationwide. The agency keeps track of how many visas are approved, but not of how many are actually issued.
Nor does it keep track of when temporary workers arrive in the country, when they are supposed to leave, where they will be working, or what they will be doing while they're here. And who makes sure the workers eventually go home? "That's the responsibility of the employers," Bergeron said. About the program [] The H-1B program was created by Congress in 1990 to provide U.S. employers each year with access to up to 65,000 foreign professionals in certain specialty occupations.
The idea was to help American employers stay competitive in the global economy. [] Most of these workers are computer programmers, engineers, physical therapists, accountants and teachers.
Foreign fashion models, chefs and athletes also use the visas.
In recent years, the program has become increasingly dominated by the high-tech industry. [] The H-1B is good for three years and is renewable once, making it valid for a total of six years.
But H-1B holders must remain with the employer who obtained it for them or the visa becomes invalid.
For that reason, critics have said the visa leaves the workers effectively indentured to their employers.

Bill to hire foreigners runs into turbulence; White House dislikes compromise measure

WASHINGTON -- Lobbyists for the high-tech industry began yesterday with victory at hand in their long quest for congressional approval to hire more foreign workers.
But by day's end, they were in disarray and facing possible defeat. Key House and Senate Republicans had reached a final agreement yesterday morning shortly after midnight to increase the flow of foreign professionals by as many as 190,000 over the next six years. Votes were promptly scheduled in the House and Senate by GOP leaders and the bill was to be laid on President Clinton's desk over the weekend. But industry's apparent victory unraveled during the course of the hot afternoon.
The key moment came when the White House, after reading the 34-page compromise, issued a veto threat late yesterday that was even stronger than one it had issued on July 16. "Unfortunately, this Republican agreement fails to provide adequate training and protections for U.S. workers," said White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
"In its current form, the president would have no choice but to veto it.
We are working on proposed revisions to the Republicans' bill and would like to address the skills shortage before Congress leaves on recess." But that seemed increasingly unlikely as the day wore on. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a longtime opponent of the program, which allows 65,000 new foreign professionals to enter the country each year and stay for up to six years, announced plans to block debate on the bill in the Senate.
The bill would greatly expand the H-1B program, so-named for the visa the foreign workers are issued. Meanwhile, in the House, Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Simi Valley, a member of the Judiciary Committee, began urging other Republicans to oppose the GOP compromise.
Sources said he wanted tighter restrictions on the program.
He could not be reached for comment late yesterday. But by the end of the day, the House Republican leadership, which had hoped to move the GOP compromise quickly to the president's desk for his signature, had cancelled a vote scheduled for today on the compromise legislation. The Senate is planning to recess this weekend.
Even if the House reschedules the vote for next week, the Senate would not be around to approve the bill.
Therefore, it seemed likely late yesterday that final action would be put off until Congress returns from its break in early September. Some warned that the window of opportunity might be closed by then. "How many people want to vote for 190,000 new foreign workers two months before an election?" said a key Republican staff member. Companies lobbying for the bill, including Qualcomm, San Diego's wireless communications giant, had been forced to stop hiring under the H-1B program May 11 because the annual allotment of 65,000 visas for all U.S. employers had been used.
The high-tech companies say they must hire foreign workers because there are not enough skilled Americans to fill the available jobs -- a claim critics dispute. The agreement reached yesterday would raise the cap on the number of new H-1B workers to 85,000 this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30; 95,000 in 1999; 105,000 in 2000; and 115,000 in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. The annual cap then would return to the current level of 65,000. The GOP compromise would require some -- but not all -- companies using the H-1B program to affirm that they had taken reasonable steps to recruit American workers before hiring a foreign worker. They also would have to report to the government that they had not laid off an American worker with similar skills in the same geographic area 90 days before or after applying for the H-1B worker. But critics of the bill yesterday said fewer than 5 percent of the companies using the H-1B program would be forced to abide by the new rules. "This is a loophole for big companies to hire cheap indentured labor," said Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., an opponent. The compromise also would require companies to pay a $250 fee for each H-1B visa it receives for a foreign worker.
The money would go into two funds for high-tech training and education.
White House spokesman Siewert said the money raised by the fee would be insufficient. American Business for Legal Immigration, an industry group, had called the compromise "fair and flexible" and urged Congress to approve it quickly.

Stephen has a house near Silicon Valley, a wife and two children -- one of whom requires expensive medical treatment and the full-time care of his mother. Although he possesses marketable skills like C++, PLC and Visual Basic, the 48-year-old engineer and computer programmer hasn't been able to land a permanent job since he was replaced last year by a lower-paid foreign worker at a well-known electronics firm.
To pay the bills, he works on a temporary contract training his replacement. Sree is an engineer on an H-1B skilled-employment visa at a major U.S. manufacturer.
He has been refused a raise for the past two years and says that he could work elsewhere for 40 percent more than he is making now -- except that he can't work for another employer according to the terms of his visa.
If his green card comes through, he says, his employer won't be upset to see him leave because there will likely be another H-1B visa holder to take his place. Stephen and Sree are among the forgotten ones in the current debate over expanding the H-1B guest-worker program for temporary foreign professionals.
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote sometime later this week on H.R. 3736, a bill that would increase by nearly 200,000 the number of high-tech braceros that U.S. companies could sponsor during the next four years. Some special-interest groups, continuing to cite a study discredited by the General Accounting Office, argue that expanding the H-1B program is the only solution to an acute shortage of high-tech workers.
Yet the usual signs of a labor shortage in this area are absent.
Wage increases of engineers and information-technology workers have tracked closely with those of other professional groups, while hiring rates in these fields are quite low -- commonly 2 percent to 4 percent of applicants at major companies.
At the same time, reports of high demand have spurred a 40 percent increase in computer-science majors. The real shortage today is of recently trained high-tech workers who will work long hours at entry-level salaries.
With a limited pool of recent grads available, companies look to the H-1B program to provide a large pool of inexpensive foreign labor.
Unlike permanent immigrants who enjoy the same workplace rights as other American professionals, these workers are virtually indentured to their employers, subject to deportation if they lose their corporate sponsorship.
As a result, they are often hired at lower salaries and don't enjoy the same opportunities for advancement as their colleagues.
Their substantial presence in the work force also depresses wages and working conditions for all technical professionals. Expanding the H-1B program throws a monkey wrench into the free-market system.
Instead of letting the natural mechanism of wage rates regulate the size of the labor force, the federal government would increase a pool of artificially low-priced labor that allows industry to meet demand without raising wages.
As with other attempts by Congress to tamper with the basic mechanics of free markets, this one has several untoward consequences. First, by making it cheaper to hire H-1B workers than to hire or retrain U.S. workers, Congress gives industry a strong incentive to shun qualified older workers like Stephen who are unable to work as cheaply.
According to a recent study by the National Science Foundation, only 19 percent of computer-science graduates are working in their field just 20 years after graduation.
And of those who do try to stay?
The unemployment rate last year for computer programmers over 50 years of age was a whopping 17 percent, according to Computerworld magazine.
Meanwhile, many workers who could be retrained for jobs in hot, new technologies are overlooked because it is faster and cheaper to hire H-1B workers. Second, by indenturing foreign workers to their employers, the government creates an environment of exploitation of temporary foreign professionals like Sree. Without the essential tools to negotiate a fair market value for labor, H-1B workers very often can't obtain better salaries, raises and promotions. Third, the federal government never succeeds in balancing labor supply and demand.
The H-1B program began in 1991 amid dire predictions by industry of a looming engineers shortage.
But when tens of thousands of temporary high-tech workers began to hit the shores, labor demand suddenly contracted due to recession, corporate restructuring and massive defense cutbacks.
The result was the highest engineering unemployment rate in history and declining wages by 1994. Now Congress is considering a massive increase in the same program just as the cycle is beginning to turn down again, with more than 200,000 layoffs in the high-tech sector during the past several months and a near tripling of the engineering unemployment rate in the last quarter. Finally, by relying on temporary high-tech guest-workers, the United States risks the gradual erosion of its vital technical infrastructure.
Each additional guest-worker is another lost opportunity to develop the permanent U.S. technical work force, both native and foreign-born.
The cumulative effect of hundreds of thousands of these missed investments is already being felt.
U.S. real engineering wages are no higher than they were 10 years ago, even as profits have soared in the high-tech sector. Since 1992, the number of permanent admissions of foreign engineers and computer scientists has declined by more than 20 percent, though temporary admissions have nearly doubled. This summer at a Cato Institute forum on H-1B legislation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Bruce Josten said that part of the American advantage is the "freedom to move people."
We disagree.
The true American advantage is the freedom of people to move -- to better careers, to better pay, to better opportunities that enable them to improve their lives even as they help improve the U.S. standard of living.
It is that capacity to energize the individual that is the genius of the American free-enterprise system -- and why our high-tech industry is the envy of the world.
Increased reliance on indentured guest-workers robs U.S. workers of rewarding, life-long careers and deprives guest-workers of basic rights in the workplace.

U.S. aims to expand high-tech visa plan; Skilled foreigners filling acute needs

WASHINGTON -- Like an old computer running out of memory, the U.S. visa program that allows high-tech foreign workers into this country once again is rapidly reaching its limit. The Clinton administration and Congress are getting ready to upgrade the system. But there appears to be sharp disagreement about exactly how that should be done. The Senate Judiciary Committee took a first step yesterday, approving a bill that would sharply boost the number of high-tech foreign workers allowed into the United States each year. The increase has been sought by San Diego's Chamber of Commerce, the wireless communication giant, Qualcomm, and other high-tech businesses, to address what they view as severe labor shortages. Two years ago, Congress raised the visa ceiling from 65,000 to 115,000 under the law that calls for the allotment to drop to 107,500 in 2001 and back to 65,000 thereafter. Since then, the high-tech industry has hungered for more.
It says the existing visa quota has hamstrung a burgeoning industry that faces a shortage of highly skilled workers in this country.
The so-called H-1B visas allow foreigners to work in the United States for three years.
The visas can be renewed once, for a total of six years. Industry representatives hailed the Senate panel's 15-3 vote to approve a measure that would dramatically raise the cap. Under the bill sponsored by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and others, the quota would be raised to 195,000 H-1B visas each year for the next three years. The Senate panel also approved a Feinstein amendment that would provide grants and scholarships for science and technology programs. The decision "sends a strong message about the need to address this critical problem," said Sandra Boyd, chairman of the American Business for Legal Immigration, a group of more than 200 companies and associations. "U.S. employers must have access to an adequate supply of qualified workers in this country if we are to continue to grow the economy," Boyd said. But the Clinton administration suggests the Senate panel's bill may be unacceptable to the president because it lacks a training provision for U.S. workers. "We are ready to support a reasonable increase in the number of H-1B visas as long as it reflects a balanced approach that protects and prepares the U.S. work force," White House spokesman Jake Siewart said. Some Democratic and Republican lawmakers favor a more limited cap increase, saying the labor shortages cited by the high-tech industry have not been proved.
They also said they want assurances that authorities crack down on fraud and provide enough protections for American workers. Other critics -- including those in organized labor and anti-immigration groups -- contend the high-tech industry simply wants to obtain cheap labor and hold down wages. But representatives of the high-tech industry in San Diego said this week the quotas cannot be raised quickly enough, and the need for skilled workers is significant. "We're happy with plans to increase the high-tech visas," said Diana Baldwin, a spokeswoman for Qualcomm, which has lobbied the government to increase the cap. Angela Villagrana, a spokeswoman for the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, added: "There is a shortage of skilled workers and our high-tech companies need to expand.
We realize it's the brain power of the future." Yesterday, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. offered a narrower version of the Hatch bill, calling for a 145,000 ceiling.
Kennedy proposed a massive infusion of funding to train U.S. workers for high-tech jobs. The Kennedy effort was rejected. Earlier this month, Rep. Lamar Smith, D-Tex., chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, introduced a measure to raise the cap to 160,000 for the fiscal year 2000. But Smith said the increases would be contingent on efforts to reduce fraud within the visa program. High-tech industry officials said Smith's bill would stifle the economy. More than half the H-1B visas are obtained by citizens of India or China. The volume of H-1B visa applications was so great last year the INS "effectively stopped taking applications" June 15, agency spokeswoman Eylene Schmidt said.
In 1999, the agency mistakenly issued 20,000 H-1B visas beyond the quota, officials have said. This year, the agency also has issued visas at a pace in which the existing 115,000 cap will be reached quickly, according to the high-tech industry.

U.S. aims to expand high-tech visa plan; Skilled foreigners filling acute needs

WASHINGTON -- Like an old computer running out of memory, the U.S. visa program that allows high-tech foreign workers into this country once again is rapidly reaching its limit.
The Clinton administration and Congress are getting ready to upgrade the system.
But there appears to be sharp disagreement about exactly how that should be done.
The Senate Judiciary Committee took a first step yesterday, approving a bill that would sharply boost the number of high-tech foreign workers allowed into the United States each year.
The increase has been sought by San Diego's Chamber of Commerce, the wireless communication giant, Qualcomm, and other high-tech businesses, to address what they view as severe labor shortages.
Two years ago, Congress raised the visa ceiling from 65,000 to 115,000 under the law that calls for the allotment to drop to 107,500 in 2001 and back to 65,000 thereafter.
Since then, the high-tech industry has hungered for more.  It says the existing visa quota has hamstrung a burgeoning industry that faces a shortage of highly skilled workers in this country.  The so-called H-1B visas allow foreigners to work in the United States for three years.  The visas can be renewed once, for a total of six years.
Industry representatives hailed the Senate panel's 15-3 vote to approve a measure that would dramatically raise the cap.
Under the bill sponsored by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and others, the quota would be raised to 195,000 H-1B visas each year for the next three years.
The Senate panel also approved a Feinstein amendment that would provide grants and scholarships for science and technology programs.
The decision "sends a strong message about the need to address this critical problem," said Sandra Boyd, chairman of the American Business for Legal Immigration, a group of more than 200 companies and associations.
"U.S. employers must have access to an adequate supply of qualified workers in this country if we are to continue to grow the economy," Boyd said.
But the Clinton administration suggests the Senate panel's bill may be unacceptable to the president because it lacks a training provision for U.S. workers.
"We are ready to support a reasonable increase in the number of H-1B visas as long as it reflects a balanced approach that protects and prepares the U.S. work force," White House spokesman Jake Siewart said.
Some Democratic and Republican lawmakers favor a more limited cap increase, saying the labor shortages cited by the high-tech industry have not been proved.  They also said they want assurances that authorities crack down on fraud and provide enough protections for American workers.
Other critics -- including those in organized labor and anti-immigration groups -- contend the high-tech industry simply wants to obtain cheap labor and hold down wages.
But representatives of the high-tech industry in San Diego said this week the quotas cannot be raised quickly enough, and the need for skilled workers is significant.
"We're happy with plans to increase the high-tech visas," said Diana Baldwin, a spokeswoman for Qualcomm, which has lobbied the government to increase the cap.
Angela Villagrana, a spokeswoman for the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, added: "There is a shortage of skilled workers and our high-tech companies need to expand.  We realize it's the brain power of the future."
Yesterday, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. offered a narrower version of the Hatch bill, calling for a 145,000 ceiling.  Kennedy proposed a massive infusion of funding to train U.S. workers for high-tech jobs.
The Kennedy effort was rejected.
Earlier this month, Rep. Lamar Smith, D-Tex., chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, introduced a measure to raise the cap to 160,000 for the fiscal year 2000. But Smith said the increases would be contingent on efforts to reduce fraud within the visa program.
High-tech industry officials said Smith's bill would stifle the economy.
More than half the H-1B visas are obtained by citizens of India or China.
The volume of H-1B visa applications was so great last year the INS "effectively stopped taking applications" June 15, agency spokeswoman Eylene Schmidt said.  In 1999, the agency mistakenly issued 20,000 H-1B visas beyond the quota, officials have said.
This year, the agency also has issued visas at a pace in which the existing 115,000 cap will be reached quickly, according to the high-tech industry.

Study looks at foreigners in high-tech jobs; 420,000 here now; bills may hike total

Foreigners employed temporarily in U.S. high-tech jobs currently number more than 420,000, according to a new study released this week.
Under pending U.S. legislation, the total could rise within two years to at least 710,000, the study says.
Because of caps on employment visas and country quotas, only a small portion of the workers -- as little as 15 percent -- will be able to gain permanent, legal U.S. residency.  The report was prepared by the Institute for the Study of International Migration at Georgetown University.
In the past, about half of those admitted under the special category, known as H-1B, have sought to remain legally in the United States after their visas expired at the end of six years.
Susan Martin, the institute's director, said raising the annual foreign guest worker ceiling without addressing the impediments to permanent U.S. residency is irresponsible.
"The system will be producing tens of thousands of potential visa overstayers yearly," she said.
At least four measures have been introduced in Congress to raise the H-1B visa program beyond its current 115,000 annual limit, said Allen Kay, spokesman for Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House immigration subcommittee.
Last year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service exceeded the limit on the visas by nearly 20,000. Officials blamed the error on improper tallying of totals from the four centers that process the highly sought but controversial visas.
The H-1B temporary work visa is the principle mechanism through which highly skilled workers and professionals enter the United States.  Created in 1990, it since has become known as the high-tech visa because of companies' vigorous efforts to increase the cap.
Critics say the technology companies are turning to foreign programmers and engineers as a way to get cheaper workers.
B. Lindsay Lowell, the report's author, said another study indicates there is a gap in earnings between permanent and temporary workers, including H-1Bs who hold master's degrees or above, in the high-tech industry.
The push for substantially raising or even removing the ceiling on H-1B visas is coming from Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, Qualcomm and other high-tech companies across the United States.
Current proposals in Congress for new caps range from 195,000 to Rep. Smith's suggestion for an unlimited number, said Kay.
Whether legislators also will address the foreign guest workers' dilemma in gaining permanent status, he said, "would be wildly speculative."
"The issue here is not really the numbers but the qualifications of the individuals receiving H-1B status," said Kay.
Nevertheless, until the migration institute's study, Congress has debated changes in the numbers with no clear idea of the size of the population of temporary foreign workers that has accumulated over the years.  Nor were legislators able to grasp the future implications for those seeking to gain legal residency.

Imported know-how; Debate over foreign labor gives Congress a workout

Sanja Jha, who oversees development of chipsets and systems software at Qualcomm, bristles when he hears complaints that U.S. companies are using special visas to import low-paid talent.
Jha, who was born in India and raised in Scotland, says the foreign workers on his team make just as much as their U.S. counterparts.  He says the reason he hires foreign workers is that it is hard to find U.S. talent.
"Finding new people is the biggest pain in my life," he says.
The debate over imported foreign labor is a point of contention as Congress considers expanding the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. firms to hire skilled workers from abroad.  The issue is whether to raise the annual allotment of H-1Bs from 115,000 to 200,000 per year.
The H-1B visa -- it's named for a section of immigration law -- allows employers to hire foreigners who hold master's degrees or doctorates for three-year stints, provided they are paid no lower than 5 percent less than the prevailing wage in their profession.
Critics, including the AFL-CIO and lobbying groups of engineers, contend that companies often pay foreigners far below the 5 percent allowed by law.  By hiring low-paid foreign workers, critics say, employers are keeping U.S. wages low.
"Employers are addicted to the H-1B," says Norm Matloff, a professor at the University of California Davis and one of the leading critics of the program.  "Even though the law requires that businesses hire H-1Bs at the same (pay) rate as U.S. workers, there are zillions of loopholes that allow them to pay lower rates."
Many high-tech executives, including Jha, say H-1B workers are needed because there is a shortage of skilled domestic employees.
"We've got three times as many openings as there are local applicants," says Tony Chartrand, who does the hiring at Ericsson's operations in San Diego.  "If the competency we need can be found down the street, that's great.  But if the competency comes from India, we can work with that too."
Chartrand says that in a way, he would prefer to hire domestic workers, since it takes a lot of time and money to hire a foreigner.  There's the expense of hiring an immigration lawyer and the aggravation of repeated delays in the application process.
Jha notes that each time he casts a net for employees, he typically extends offers to about 20-25 people, but only 12 to 15 accept.  "The acceptance rate used to be a lot higher, but San Diego has gotten so competitive that a lot of people are handling three or four offers," he says.
Given the intense competition, Jha says, it would be foolish for Qualcomm to offer job applicants a low-ball salary -- H-1B or not.
"We have to offer very competitive salaries if we're going to lure talent from such competitors as Motorola or Lucent," Jha says.  "Besides, we invest so much time and energy in the interviewing process that it would be a waste of money to have someone reject our offer because it's low."
Qualcomm's H-1B workers -- most of whom are software engineers -- make an average salary of about $66,532. That's about 5 percent ahead of the average salary for domestic software engineers, which is pegged at $63,199 by the U.S. Department of Labor.
Of the 212 H-1B applications reviewed by the Union-Tribune, only two workers made less than $40,000. Qualcomm, which has 7,000 local workers, has filed about 700 H-1B visa applications, although not all slots have been filled.
Similarly, of the 36 H-1B applications for Ericsson reviewed by the Union-Tribune, only one employee made less than $40,000, while three others made more than $125,000. Ericsson's operation in San Diego has 900 employees, and 175 of them are H-1B workers.
Yash Kharia is a H-1B worker.
In the mid-1990s, Kharia, who comes from a family of engineers in India, went to the India Institute of Technology, or IIT, paying tuition of just $22 per semester.
The main hurdle was the stringent entrance exam, since IIT accepts only 3 percent of applicants, compared to 11-18 percent at Ivy League schools in the United States.
After graduating, Kharia worked briefly at a short-lived Qualcomm operation in India.  When Qualcomm closed the plant in 1999, Kharia switched to Motorola.  But then his former boss at Qualcomm got in touch, saying he had landed a job at Ericsson in the United States and invited Kharia on board.
"All I had to do was fill out some forms that I got over the Internet and Ericsson did the rest," says Kharia, who says he is adequately compensated.
Not all H-1B employees are well-paid, though.
Marotz, a software firm in Jamul, typically pays its H-1Bs as little as $27,831 during their first six months in the United States.  Gradually, the employees -- most of them come from the former Soviet Union -- work their way to the $50,000 or $60,000 level.  But that can take more than a year.
Marotz appears to be an anomaly.  A review of H-1B filings shows that no other company in San Diego County pays that low.

A need for foreign-born professionals

The H-1B program is a prompt, lawful way for U.S. employers to hire foreign-born professionals (such as engineers and computer programmers) on a temporary basis.
This program allows U.S. businesses to recruit and hire the best-qualified candidates from around the world and compete on a level playing field with foreign companies in such key industries as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and education. The issue before Congress is whether the number of H-1B visas granted by the U.S. government should be raised from current levels, and if so, should Congress limit the use of the H-1B program by placing additional restrictions on employers and companies. Holders of H-1B visas are foreign professionals hired on a temporary basis by U.S. employers.
They can only be hired for "specialty occupations," which are defined under the law as jobs that require a professional who has the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in their field of specialty.
Examples are doctors, engineers, professors, accountants, researchers, medical personnel and computer professionals. The subject of H-1B visas was most recently addressed by Congress in the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA). The ACWIA increased the number of H-1B visas to be granted beginning in 1999. According to the ACWIA, no more than 115,000 visas would be granted for each Fiscal Year 1999 and 2000, 107,500 in 2001, and 65,000 after that. ACWIA also added new requirements for employers who use a higher percentage of H-1B workers, such as requiring high-use companies to first recruit in the United States, and not lay off American workers before using the H-1B program. ACWIA also stiffened the punishments for companies that violate the law. The new punishments include fines of up to $35,000, a three-year bar from participating in visa programs, and repaying salaries of any underpaid foreign professionals.
ACWIA further requires employers to pay a fee of $500 per visa to fund education and training programs for U.S. workers. U.S. employers use the H-1B program to hire foreign professionals with highly needed skills.
Employers typically hire H-1B professionals for three reasons: [] Needed skills: To obtain essential skills or rare and unique knowledge; [] Global market expertise: For their special expertise in overseas needs, markets, trends or distribution, allowing U.S. businesses to compete in global markets; [] Temporary shortages: To fill temporary shortages of needed skills.
If American companies are prevented from hiring essential people to fill critical positions, an increasing number of jobs dependent upon these positions will go unfilled each year, resulting in American jobs being lost and American projects losing out to foreign competition.
As the U.S. economy becomes increasingly global, H-1B professionals become ever more essential to San Diego's continued economic growth. Larry Fitch, president and chief executive officer of San Diego Workforce Partnership, Inc., states, "The only way we will be able to permanently resolve the issue of importing workers for high technology positions is by growing our own work force.
This will require a major commitment to and investment in our youth.
Unfortunately, this is a long-term solution, and the crisis is now.
We must continue to use H-1B visas in the short term, and ensure that we are accessing the training dollars that are available with the visas to upgrade the skills of our current workers." ACWIA increased the number of temporary visas through fiscal year 2001, while making significant changes to the program to enhance domestic work-force protections.
However, the increases mandated in ACWIA were insufficient; the H-1B visa cap was reached well before the end of Fiscal Year 1999 and was reached in March in Fiscal Year 2000. Kim Giannone, Employment Specialist, Insight Electronics LLC says, "We firmly support an increase, and even the removal of the limit on H-1Bs. We are an international company, and we have problems filling our technical and engineering positions in all areas.
It is very difficult (if not impossible) for us to fill our openings with the available U.S. workers." Among other things, the legislation before Congress would accomplish the following: [] Increase the H-1B visa cap to 200,000 or more for each year for the period FY 2000-2003. [] Exempt from the H-1B visa cap non-immigrants employed by higher educational institutions and research institutions, and foreign graduates of U.S. masters and doctoral degree programs sponsored by U.S. employers within six months of their graduation. [] Permit extensions of H-1B status past the six-year limit for H-1B beneficiaries who have immigrant visa applications pending. Raising the H-1B visa limitation will have an immediate and significant impact on the San Diego economy.
San Diego is one of the fastest growing regions in the country in the high-tech, biotechnology and research industries.
San Diego also is home for hundreds of start-up companies and relatively small businesses.
These industries have the greatest demand for the H-1B program. San Diego employers use the H-1B program to obtain skilled foreign professionals at a time when unemployment is at an all-time low and competition for skilled technical workers is at an all-time high. Increasing the H-1B visa cap without imposing restrictions on employers would greatly enhance the growth of such companies as well as encourage increased investment into the San Diego region.

Y2K fixes may open U.S. to risk, CIA analyst says

A CIA analyst responsible for watching the nation's computer infrastructure is quietly warning network administrators that America's reliance on foreign programmers to fix the Y2K computer glitch poses a security risk. Computer security experts have long warned of a "digital Pearl Harbor" in which an enemy could exploit America's reliance on computer technology to steal secrets or spread chaos by sabotaging critical computer networks. Now, the warnings issued by Terrill D. Maynard of the National Infrastructure Protection Center appear to reflect increasing worries among top U.S. officials about America's vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. In an article intended for system administrators, Maynard specifically warned that foreign programmers hired to fix Y2K software problems may have covertly left an open door for a future network attack. President Clinton established the protection center at the FBI last year in part to warn U.S. industry of such cyber threats. Maynard, chief of the NIPC's Analysis and Warning Section, could not be reached for comment yesterday.
FBI officials said he was out of town. Other computer security experts said the center's warning may be valid, although they have no way of knowing whether foreign operatives are actually exploiting the Y2K glitch. "Certainly there's been a bunch of stuff within the Department of Defense in recent weeks, basically directives saying that we had to take extra steps to address Y2K concerns," said Ron Broersma, a network security expert at SPAWAR, the Navy's San Diego-based Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command. Broersma said directives issued by Arthur L. Money, the Pentagon's top civilian for command, control, communications and intelligence, have sought to address Y2K problems on two fronts. One concern addressed the possibility of programming flaws that might give unauthorized users a "back door" access to restricted computer networks, or allow them to launch malicious code, Broersma said. The other concern raised the possibility that foreign attacks on computer networks might be disguised as a Y2K glitch. Maynard said Y2K work has given foreign programmers "unprecedented access" to U.S. computer systems.
That's because the job of checking millions of lines of computer code for the "Year 2000" date glitch has overwhelmed what Maynard calls "trusted" programmers. He also identified Israel and India as countries that might be most likely to exploit their role in providing Y2K services to U.S. industry and government. Citing publicly available reports, Maynard noted that both Israel and India have tried to obtain industrial or military secrets from the United States. Both countries also have been developing the computer-based capabilities to wage "cyberwar," and both countries are also major providers of Y2K services. Or, in other words, both countries have the motive, capability and opportunity to insert software instructions that could be used to manipulate some computer networks. Dan Geer of SystemExperts in Sudbury, Mass., said Maynard and others issuing such warnings are "the professional paranoids in this space." Geer added he was skeptical that such a covert campaign, even if mounted by a foreign government, could remain secret for long. Deborah Stagg, who oversaw Y2K work for the San Diego Data Processing Center, said she experienced no problems with the India software company that has completed its work on the city of San Diego's systems. "We thoroughly tested every condition with my users and with my core staff," Stagg said.
"Everything matched up perfectly." Stagg added: "I think this guy is just an alarmist.
You know, there are so many of them out there on this Y2K thing." But a former U.S. intelligence official, who agreed to speak only if unnamed, described Maynard as a longtime defense intelligence analyst. "These are prudent steps," the former official said, adding that the NIPC has been working to both understand the threat of computer-based sabotage and to lay plans for how the government should best respond. Such concerns have been frequently discussed by computer security experts in recent years. Just this spring, Department of Defense officials acknowledged that highly coordinated electronic attacks were targeting unclassified-but-critical computer networks at military sites throughout the United States. The months-long attacks, which appeared to originate in Russia, also hit networks operated by private research and development institutes, according to press reports. Maynard raised the Y2K issue last week in Arlington, Va., during a conference of military officials, computer security consultants and defense contractors. Yesterday, Maynard's warnings were delivered to a far larger audience when an article he wrote was posted on a Web site hosted by the SANS Institute, an international research and education cooperative for more than 60,000 systems administrators. "The unprecedented `trusted' system access given to untested foreign computer software development companies and programmers in the Year 2000 remediation effort has offered a unique opportunity for potential adversaries to implant malicious code," Maynard wrote. In addition to Israel and India, Maynard said France, Germany, Russia and Taiwan represent a "second tier" of countries with cyberwar capabilities that also have sought U.S. economic secrets.
These five countries have not been major sources of Y2K work, however. Maynard's comments may raise a new issue in the debate over visas granted to foreign workers under the H-1B program, intended by Congress to bolster the technical work force of America's high-tech companies. "It's not a realistic look at the population or the people who come here" under the H-1B program, said Grace Zimmerman of Larrabee and Associates, a San Diego law firm specializing exclusively in immigration law for corporate clients. Generally, these are foreign workers who come to the United States to attend college and they want to stay, Zimmerman said. "It's certainly not within their best interests to engage in this kind of espionage or destruction of systems, for which they can be criminally prosecuted," the lawyer said.
"These are people who are coming here to establish a life for themselves in the United States."

INS handed out high-tech visas lavishly; May have exceeded legal cap by as many as 20,000

WASHINGTON -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service has exceeded this year's limit on visas for temporary high-tech foreign workers, granting as many as 10,000 to 20,000 above the 115,000 limit set by Congress. An INS spokeswoman yesterday confirmed a miscount in the number of visas approved.
The agency has hired an outside auditor to determine how far over the legal cap it went because the agency itself remains uncertain. "We do know we went over.
But, at this point, we're not speculating by how many.
That's part of what the audit is supposed to find out," said the spokeswoman, Eyleen Schmidt. Schmidt said the agency first noticed "anomalies" in the numbers in June. INS officials disclosed the problem to House and Senate staffers last week. They told the staffers the range of extra visas was 10,000 to 20,000, making the total as much as 10 percent above the legal cap. Awarding too many of the controversial H-1B visas, dubbed high-tech visas because of that industry's vigorous effort last year to nearly double the number granted, is likely to bolster efforts to reform the agency, which controls foreigners' legal and illegal entry into the country. The INS is trying to stave off legislation that would break it into two separate agencies within the Justice Department.
Other proposals call for dismantling it and spreading its parts even farther, including some to the State Department and others to Labor. "The (INS') problems are getting bigger, not smaller," said Allen Kay, a spokesman for Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, yesterday.
"The INS is required to obey the law like everyone else." The subcommittee will almost certainly hold oversight hearings to examine the matter, he added. Among questions that need to be answered, he said, are how too many visas were granted, and why, when the INS first noticed a problem in June, it failed to report the miscalculation until last week. Smith was dismayed and upset when subcommittee staffers told him of the miscalculation, Kay said. "The first word out of his mouth was `incompetence,' " Kay said. Suggestions on correcting the problem are coming from Capitol Hill as well as the INS, but no agreement has been reached. "At this point in time, rescinding the visas is not one of the options we're exploring," INS spokeswoman Schmidt said. Options that are being considered include laying the excess visas off on another fiscal year, including fiscal year 2000. Another suggestion has been to assign them to earlier fiscal years in which the cap was not reached, she said. Four service processing centers -- located in Vermont, Texas, Nebraska and in California at Laguna Niguel -- count the H-1B applications as they are approved.
The information is forwarded periodically to a mainframe computer at INS headquarters in Washington. Somehow, Schmidt said, not all approvals were counted by the mainframe. Congress created the H-1B visa program in 1990 to allow foreigners with a bachelor's degree or higher, or distinguished merit or ability, to work in the United States.
In the first six years of the program, the numbers never reached the annual cap of 65,000. But in 1997 the cap was reached for the first time.
And the high-tech industry stepped up its efforts to substantially raise or even remove the cap.
In 1998, Congress temporarily raised the number of visas to 115,000 for fiscal years 1999 and 2000, and to 107,500 for fiscal year 2001. After that, it is to return to 65,000. Critics of the H-1B program strenuously fought the high-tech industry's efforts, arguing that many U.S. programmers were jobless.
They said the industry was turning to foreign programmers and engineers as a way to get cheaper workers. With the raising of the cap, employers were required to pay a $500 fee that helps fund training and educational programs for U.S. workers. This past June, the INS stopped accepting applications for 1999 H-1Bs, saying they had received enough to fill the cap.
In August, the agency announced it had reached the limit. Now, it appears, it may have reached it earlier. Of the 108,386 visas granted by June, the agency said, 46 percent were from India, 10 percent from China, 4 percent from Canada and 3 percent from the Philippines.
Other countries included Taiwan, Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom, Pakistan and Russia.

This program creates indentured servants Qualcomm continually complains about a worker shortage, even though it recently laid off several hundred people.
It's interesting to note that late last year, Qualcomm was begging Uncle Sam to allow more foreign workers into the country through the H-1B program. Despite frequently submitting my resume to Qualcomm while constantly improving my skills and revising my resume, it has never even bothered to give me a phone interview.
And it keeps complaining about a shortage of workers?
I finally reached the conclusion that Qualcomm probably doesn't treat its employees any better than it treats their candidates. In the case of other local employers, most of the people doing the interviewing don't realize that most competent programmers can easily learn new languages once they have mastered the art of coding. In my current job, I'm now developing dynamic web content using PERL and JavaScript.
It's interesting to note that I had absolutely no prior work experience nor training in these particular programming languages.
Many employers will turn down candidates unless they have precisely the right experience and key words on their resume, however. Is there really a shortage, or is corporate America not willing to be more open-minded in its recruiting efforts? The high-tech industry continues to proclaim that recent college graduates are earning salaries averaging $47,000. I earned my B.S. in computer science in 1995, have been constantly updating my skills, and always remain dedicated to my work.
As of today, I make not a penny over $35,000 per year as a mid-level webmaster with a large, international company.
Perhaps there is actually a glut of talent in San Diego? Perhaps the so-called shortage is just a ruse to get Uncle Sam to approve even more guest worker visas.
As for immigration, I have no problem with granting permanent citizenship to foreigners who can contribute to this country.
On the other hand, the H-1B program merely creates indentured servants. KEVIN C. KEY San Diego Downtown ballpark process roils the public After attending my first City Council meeting Oct. 5, I came away wondering. The most important item on the agenda, the ballpark Environmental Impact Report, for which most of us arrived on or before 10 a.m., did not commence until other items were disposed of.
Then John Moores and his proteges were given 30 minutes to extol the virtues of the ballpark.
Ironically, he admitted that the location was neither his first nor second choice. The city smoke and mirrors department otherwise known as the EIR evaluators then itemized the numerous impact problems with the location (excessive lighting, noise, traffic, homeless displacement, etc). Then they brushed them all aside by suggesting WWII blackout curtains, replacing windows with soundproof glass and the monumental traffic impact as well, San Diego was going to have increased traffic from growth anyway so that's really SANDAG's problem.
The homeless, well that's someone else's problem also. After discussion between the City Council and the EIR evaluators, it was noon and the mayor called a two-hour lunch break, but not before she used her bully pulpit to extol the ballpark plan.
She failed to show up at 2 p.m. and Deputy Mayor Bryon Wear stood in.
Then it was time for some more city agenda.
Finally at 3 p.m. Golding showed up and the public testimony began.
By this time many in the audience had left. We had been forced to wait five hours before hearing the first public speaker to question the proposed ballpark plan.
This is Golding's idea of participatory democracy? She then proceeded in an abusive manner to interrupt numerous opposition speakers stating "by law" their comments did not pertain to the issue, therefore they could not continue in that vein of commentary.
Each interruption cut into the speaker's meager allotment of three minutes.
Not once did she interrupt a speaker who spoke on behalf of the project. After seven hours I finally got my three minutes to speak, Golding had left an hour earlier, which was probably just as well as she probably would have interrupted me.
I came away thinking if it wasn't by intent then Golding couldn't have done a better job of destroying public input in council deliberations.
This was without doubt the most biased and worst run public meeting I have ever attended. JARVIS ROSS Point Loma The members of the public who waited for hours to speak to the San Diego City Council about the downtown ball park last week (U-T B-section Oct. 6) just don't get it.
The purpose of the "public hearing" was not to gather facts from the public or hear their complaints or approval of the plan.
The purpose was to meet a self-imposed requirement for something they have arbitrarily titled a "public hearing" and that's all.
It doesn't matter what the public thinks about the plan and the council's actions made that perfectly clear. When revenue is at stake, "logic," "reason" and "public discussion" are terms eliminated from the approval process.
Citizens who do not wish to be ignored or treated badly should stay at home.
That's the way it works in Chula Vista too. TOM DAVIS Chula Vista How much public debt is too much?
The concept of subsidizing the Padres ballpark first with $225 million in TOT funds, $50 million in redevelopment funds, then $21 million from the Port of San Diego, and now possibly tens, if not hundreds of millions more from the Port, illustrates how too much debt is never enough for our city officials. It reminds of the gangster who kills everybody in town for the loot he takes until there is no one left alive for it to even matter.
The city should kill the deal before it kills us. CHRISTIAN MICHAELS San Diego I beg to differ with Jack C. Rightweiser's Oct. 7 letter "More evidence that San Diego has minor league mentality."
He lambastes San Diego and its citizenry by referring to us as, a major league population with a minor league mentality. If anything relegates San Diego's mentality to the minor leagues, it is an inadequate library system, crumbling public schools and over-development. The fact that our city fathers don't do back flips to accommodate a swarm of gas-guzzling/super-polluters wishing to race through our downtown streets, seems more an indication of sanity and responsibility. Calling the decision minor league is a great deal like chiding someone for reading. GARY L. SMITH Old Town Re: Jim Gogek's "Yet another battle of egos in San Diego" (Opinion, Oct. 8) "You'd think leaders would learn by now," Gogek says.
But they are not interested in learning, their interest is name-plate politics.
What Gogek really shows us is that many of these politicos' ideas are only Icarusian dreams.
Glorified wax museum shows.
Any nearness of success causes them to be so overjoyed that they forget the risks involved. This land of sunshine can have its own dark days.
And upon whose shoulders do the failed attempts fall?
The ever-faithful taxpayers who foot the bill of success or failure in any "public" project.
While Moores moves on to Anaheim, Manchester moves on to Oceanside, and more of the citizens move into poverty via their potholed and ill-lit roads. DANIEL BEEMAN North Park Why California needs comprehensive train network Re: "In the future, California will need trains" (U/T Oct. 11) Existing trains would be much more effective if we reduced travel time by simple actions.
Straighten that stretch turning inland (Rose Canyon to Miramar MCAS). After extensive travel in Europe last month, I saw how tunnels have made a wonderful system of low- and high-speed trains.
But add another priority to eliminate roads crossing tracks.
These crossings should be overpasses or underpasses.
They eliminate safety hazards and benefit both automobile and train traffic. If Caltrans is not just a highway department, then it should fund these critical safety and efficiency changes. LEE BOLT San Diego

As Congress reconvenes, lots of high-tech issues to tackle

Last year, Congress got beyond its partisan rancor long enough to pass a number of laws sought by the nation's booming high-tech companies.  This year, the tech titans expect even more out of Washington.
On trade, taxes, visas, digital signatures and many other issues, the owners of technology-driven companies will be pushing for far-reaching bills, with the 106th Congress reconvening this week.
With lawmakers planning to recess in late July to attend political party conventions and launch re-election campaigns, the pressure to get bills passed early in the year will be intense.
"You can't just say, 'OK, this is a short year, so let's just put these bills in a drawer,' " said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., co-chair of the Congressional Internet Caucus.
Rather than dismiss 2000 as a do-nothing election year, tech supporters will "be pushing every step of the way," he said.  "You have to build momentum."
Now it's hot
Until 1998, technology-related issues were not particularly hot topics in Washington, both because most lawmakers were unfamiliar with the Internet and because many tech entrepreneurs were too busy making money to care about politics.
But as the Web has woven itself into the workplaces and homes of tens of millions of Americans, tech legislative issues have shot to the top of the agenda on the Hill.
And in places like Austin, Palo Alto, Boston, Seattle, Atlanta and Northern Virginia, entrepreneurs now realize their fortunes may be determined in large part by Congress's action or lack of it.
With tech companies hiring lobbyists at a frantic pace and lawmakers eagerly listening to them, bills have been moving along in a surprisingly bipartisan fashion.
In less than two years, the Republican-led Congress and Democratic White House have agreed to impose a three-year moratorium on taxes on electronic commerce, increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled immigrants, limit lawsuits against companies involved with Y2K-related software flaws, and extend copyright protections to material published on the Web.
This year, the tech agenda is even more aggressive.
Of course, electronic-commerce companies, chip makers and other sectors of the diverse high-tech business community have different priorities, but companies propelled by new technologies generally want lawmakers to help them by:
[] Expanding global trade
Since 1992, high-tech products have been the leading U.S. exports.
To increase growth, computer makers, chip manufacturers, software developers and others want greater access to foreign markets, especially China.
Tech companies want Congress to grant permanent normal trade relations status to China.
That's not a simple matter in an election year because labor unions, a core Democrat constituency, oppose expanded trade.  So do some conservatives who believe China never lives up to its agreements.
Tech companies also are demanding that government further loosen controls on the export of high-performance computers.
Again, this is a touchy issue because many legislators fear that equipment vital to our national security will end up illegally in the hands of Chinese military officials.
[] Increasing the pool of highly skilled workers
Employers are desperate for more engineers and programmers.  They want Congress to increase the number of "H-1B" temporary work visas used by companies and universities to hire foreign workers with specialized skills.
Industry was successful in boosting the visa level two years ago, but opposition from labor unions will be stiff in this election year.  Anti-immigration Republicans may oppose the visa increase as well.
Tech employers also want the government to bolster U.S. schools by providing development grants for teachers who want more computer training and scholarships for students pursuing technology-related degrees.
[] Spurring research and development
Tech-driven entrepreneurs want a permanent extension of the research and development tax credit.
[] Encouraging the growth of electronic commerce
The biggest issue is whether to allow state and local governments to collect sales taxes from online purchases.
Currently, most shoppers pay no sales taxes on Internet purchases because of a temporary tax moratorium imposed by Congress.  But as e-commerce grows, more mayors and governors are clamoring for the right to collect sales taxes.
This may be too hot of a potato for Congress to hold in an election year, so the moratorium may be extended to bump the issue into 2001.
But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal opponent of Internet taxes, could push for a permanent ban to attract attention to his presidential campaign.
Tech companies also want Congress to move on a number of other issues, such as approving the use of electronic signatures to allow more business dealings over the Internet, and settling a number of thorny privacy issues involving transfers of financial data and medical records.

High-tech workers are a visa away; In time of need, firms look to foreign shores

NEW YORK -- Oliver Sharp constantly worries about where he'll find his next hire.
As the chief technology officer of iTurf.com, which is set to launch a Web portal aimed at teens and their spending power, Sharp is obsessed with finding qualified high-tech workers in the tightest of tight labor markets.
"When I came to iTurf, nothing mattered except assembling a team," Sharp says.  "It was an absolute occupation of mine and it remains one today."
The issue faced by Sharp and others like him has raised enough concerns to get the ear of Congress.
Nineteen senators have introduced a bill to increase the number of H-1B visas -- six-year, temporary visas granted to foreigners with college degrees -- to 195,000 for the next three years.
Congress already has increased the number of H-1B visas from 65,000 in fiscal 1998 to 115,000 annually for both 1999 and 2000.
Many in the industry, however, say the H-1B visa doesn't go far enough to help the technology industry, as the H-1B visa is available for all professionals, from lawyers to physical therapists to fashion models.
About half of all H-1B visa requests for 1999 came from outside the technology industry, according to the Labor Department.
For that reason, Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., introduced the HITEC Act in late September that would create a visa -- the T-visa -- just for foreign technology workers.  It is now before the Judiciary Committee.
"The U.S. pushed globalization, but somewhere along the line the trade advocates forgot to tell immigration," says Paul O'Malley, a New York attorney specializing in immigration.  "This industry changes much faster than the legal parameters for visas or green cards."
For example, in fiscal year 1999 ending Sept. 30, the quota for the H-1B visa was reached by mid-June, and O'Malley fears it will be reached much sooner this year.
Those opposed to allowing more foreign workers into the United States say high-tech companies simply want to take advantage of less-costly foreign workers, perhaps only hiring them temporarily.
Immigrants come to the United States, says Paul Donnelly, with the Immigration Reform Coalition, because they want to be permanent residents.  Yet high-tech companies have no intentions of sponsoring them for green cards that would give them more freedom to move to a different job.
O'Malley says the temporary hiring charge is right, that technology companies often work on a project-by-project basis, and resistance to that is an example of an antiquated notion of how the industry works.
The T-visa legislation addresses the allegation that technology companies are seeking foreign workers at lower wages by requiring that a job offer a salary of at least $60,000.
Workers would be required to hold a master's or doctoral degree in mathematics, science, engineering or computer science from a U.S. university.
Businesses would pay $1,000 for each T-visa, which would be good for five years, and $500 for a five-year extension.
Despite disagreement over the solution, most parties at least agree that there is a problem finding technology workers.
A report released by the Office of Technology Policy within the Department of Commerce indicates symptoms of a tight technology labor market exist: low unemployment, high salaries and an expanding market.
The Computing Technology Industry Association, an industry trade group, claims that the United States needs 268,000 high-tech workers to solve a problem the association says costs U.S. businesses $4.5 billion a year in lost productivity.
Even the addition of the T-visa or an increase in H-1B visas might not allow enough skilled workers in.
The Commerce report notes that about 32 percent of core technology workers don't have a four-year college degree.  In addition, many high-tech workers who have a degree got it in a subject other than that required by the T-visa legislation.
Take the case of Ehud Lavski of Tel Aviv, Israel, who would like to work in the United States.
At 25, he has seven years experience in new-media work, giving him veteran status in the industry.  He's designed several CD-ROMs. He did a stint with a multimedia company.  He's been a free-lance graphic designer, directed music videos and has written and illustrated a children's book.
In short, he's a talent that most new media companies would salivate over.  His one drawback: He doesn't hold a degree.
"I had this thought that if you're good enough and a company wants you, that it would be instantaneous.  I was a little naive," Lavski says.  "People can't hire me based on my talent."
For now, Lavski said he and his brother are going into business together producing CD-ROMs in Israel.
One option that the Commerce report found hard-pressed companies taking is the outsourcing of their lower-level programming to other countries, where it can be done cheaply.
Hussam Hamadeh, a co-founder of Vault.com, a job-search Web site, says his company would prefer to keep programming on-site, even though it would cost $100 an hour vs. $20 an hour in India.
However, he says, Vault.com has 12 core technology workers and needs to fill seven more positions.  "There are a lot of new features we want to add to the site that we just can't add," Hamadeh says.
As a result, Vault.com reluctantly is considering outsourcing as an option.
"It is easier and more efficient than having someone overseas who will send the work back, and then you realize that they might not have understood the project," Hamadeh says, echoing a common concern in the industry.
For Sharp at iTurf, the issue of whether more foreign technology workers should be in the United States is a no-brainer, complexities of the situation aside.
"To the extent that talented, ambitious people want to come to work in the U.S.," Sharp says.  "I say, hallelujah.  Let the skies rain those people down on us."

SAN DIEGO AND CALIFORNIA
Vantas acquires Western Business
New York-based Vantas Inc. has acquired Carlsbad-based Western Business Centers for an undisclosed price, giving it control of six office buildings, including two in San Diego and one in Carlsbad.  Western Business, a suite management company, leases space and provides business services.  In San Diego, Vantas takes over the Rio Vista Tower in Mission Valley and Emerald Plaza downtown.  In Carlsbad, it acquired the Carlsbad Pacific Center on Palomar Airport Road. Vantas now owns 28 office building in the Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas.
Gateway exec sells part of stake
Ted Waitt, chairman of San Diego-based Gateway, sold 1.1 million shares of the company's common stock in February, according to a form released yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Waitt sold his shares between Feb. 1 and Feb. 23 at prices ranging from $53.44 a share to $63.25 a share.  He still owns more than 114.1 million Gateway shares.  Gateway is a direct-seller of personal computers.
Titan to buy Maryland company
San Diego-based Titan Corp. said it has agreed to buy closely held Pulse Engineering, a small defense contractor in Hanover, Md., that specializes in intelligence and cryptographic technologies.  The Maryland business is unrelated to the former Pulse Engineering of San Diego, which was acquired by Technitrol in 1995. Pulse's 180 employees will become a part of Titan Systems Corp., and will continue to work in Maryland.  Financial terms were not disclosed.  Titan is a diversified information-technology products and services company.
China premier denies CDMA delays
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said yesterday that "it's not true" China has suspended or delayed deployment of code division multiple access or CDMA, the wireless technology Qualcomm developed.  Qualcomm CEO Irwin Jacobs recently told shareholders that he was puzzled by reports last month that China had pulled the plug on CDMA, an apparent political victim of flagging U.S. enthusiasm for China's entry into the World Trade Organization.  Qualcomm is counting on China to boost global growth of CDMA, which it licenses.  But Zhu told reporters yesterday that "What they (reports) are saying is not true and there has never been anything like that."
Sempra unit wins stadium pact
Sempra Energy Services has won a $25 million contract to design and build a heating and cooling plant for the new NFL/Rodeo Stadium in Houston.  Sempra Energy Services is a unit of Sempra Energy, parent company of SDG&E and Southern California Gas Co.
WORLD AND NATION
Bill would raise ceiling on visas
As expected, lawmakers from areas growing from the influx of new high-tech companies introduced legislation yesterday to nearly double the number of visas issued each year for tech-savvy foreign workers.  Their bill would raise from 115,000 to 200,000 the ceiling on the six-year, H-1B visas the Immigration and Naturalization Services now issues annually to professional workers from overseas.  Claiming there are now 364,000 more high-tech jobs than workers to fill them, Rep. David Drier, R-Calif., said the present ceiling doesn't meet the needs of an increasingly digitalized economy.
Sears CEO plans to retire
Arthur Martinez plans to retire as Sears, Roebuck and Co. chairman and chief executive by year-end, and the giant retailer has hired an executive recruiting firm to help find a successor, Sears said yesterday.  Martinez, 60, discussed his retirement plans with the Sears board of directors earlier this year and started the process of choosing a successor, the company said.
Decisions due in generic drug cases
U.S. antitrust officials are expected to announce a settlement with Novartis AG's Geneva Pharmaceuticals Inc. unit and Abbott Laboratories over claims the companies agreed to keep a generic drug off the market, people familiar with the case said yesterday.  At the same time, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is expected to announce a vote approving an administrative complaint against Andrx Corp. and Aventis SA stemming from similar allegations, the people said.  Both cases are part of the commission's investigation into charges that brand-name drugmakers conspired to keep cheaper generic drugs off the market.  The FTC will not collect or seek financial penalties in either case, the sources said.

Bill offers unlimited visas for high tech

WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the House immigration subcommittee yesterday introduced legislation that would allow an unlimited number of visas over the next three years for foreigners with prized high-tech skills.
The measure offered by Rep. Lamar Smith is far broader than a version he offered just weeks ago that would have provided a one-time increase of 45,000 visas in the program.
The Texas Republican said his plan would address the booming high-tech industry's plaint of persistent labor shortages.  At a news conference, Smith said he expanded his bill after learning that this year's demand for visas outpaced last year's request by 50,000.
Industry officials, who support other House and Senate proposals that would raise the H-1B visa program beyond its current 115,000 annual limit, said Smith's bill is laced with anti-business provisions -- and they questioned whether, if implemented, it would result in any increases.
"Maybe he just felt the tide swinging dramatically against him, and he thought if he put out a large number that people wouldn't notice there were so many strings attached to it," said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America.
The provisions in Smith's bill disliked by high-tech interests include language requiring companies petitioning for H-1B visas to show they've increased their U.S. work force and raised salaries for American workers.  The bill also requires companies to file public reports on the foreign workers and their pay.
Smith's spokesman, Allen Kay, rejected the criticisms, calling the proposal "a fantastic pro-business bill."
The industry backs a bill drafted by the chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee and its immigration subcommittee that would boost the H-1B program to 195,000 visas annually over three years.  Also favored is a House version offered by Reps. David Dreier, R-Calif., and Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., that would raise the ceiling to 200,000 annually over three years.
Dreier said he welcomes Smith's newest legislation, which will be voted on today by the House immigration subcommittee.
The high-tech sector claims it requires hundreds of thousands of new workers immediately -- a contention disputed by organized labor, which argues the industry is looking overseas chiefly to hold down wages.
Lawmakers have heeded the industry's complaints about work force shortages before.
Two years ago, Congress agreed to temporarily increase the H-1B program.

Rise sought in skilled foreigners

WASHINGTON -- Racing to keep up with a booming economy, President Clinton yesterday proposed an increase of more than 85 percent in the number of skilled foreign workers who could be admitted to the United States to fill job openings in high-technology industries.
Clinton asked Congress to provide 200,000 visas for such workers in each of the next three years.
The existing law, adopted in 1998, limits the number of such visas to 107,500 in 2001. After that, under existing law, the ceiling will fall back to 65,000 a year.
The president reluctantly supported the much more modest increase in so-called H-1B visas made in 1998. But since then, technology companies say, the demand for computer programmers, engineers and other skilled workers has outstripped the supply and exceeded official expectations.

Now, as always, immigrants have been a vital part of our nation's economic, political and social development.
That's why our friends and neighbors abroad may wonder why immigration policy in the United States, the ultimate nation of immigrants, has not only been contentious, but oftentimes acrimonious. Like every important issue in a free, democratic nation, the immigration debate reflects a healthy tension that resolves itself through the political process.
Citizens who may see their economic interests jeopardized by new immigrants have the power to shape the laws that protect those interests, while the nation as a whole continues to enjoy the long-term benefits of our openness to new immigrants.
That means U.S. immigration law may not be a model of logical consistency and legal elegance, but it works. It also means, however, that few people are ever satisfied with our immigration laws, which remain in a constant state of evolution.
As is the case with our tax code, immigration rules and procedures are shaped ad hoc, responding to the crisis of the moment. A case in point is the H-1B visa program, an exception to the general framework of U.S. immigration policy that allows us to admit more highly skilled immigrants to meet the economic needs of high-tech industries experiencing critical shortages of workers with specialized training.
Right now, there is wide support in Congress to increase the number of workers allowed temporary entry to the United States under H-1B status to fill jobs which are vital to our continued economic expansion. This is an important issue because high-tech is one area where we need as free-flowing a labor market as we can get.
But it's not the only issue on the immigration agenda.
There is also a need for some legislative "clean-up" provisions to rescue from bureaucratic limbo workers already here, on the job and helping to make our economy grow.
These clean-up reforms are just good sense and don't require any change in basic immigration law or an increase in the overall number of legal immigrants. The heart-wrenching case of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy rescued at sea after his mother and nine others drowned attempting to escape from Cuba on a raft, riveted the nation's attention on just one example of the lengths to which people will go to escape tyranny and poverty and seek a better life in America. Today in America there are thousands of other cases, if not as well-known as Elian's, which carry into the 21st century the moving narrative of immigrants abandoning their homes and struggling to make a new life in this land we like to think of as a Shining City on a Hill. Four simple adjustments to the law I have in mind deal exclusively with working aliens already in the United States -- workers from war-torn Central American countries -- who have established a solid track record as law-abiding citizens supporting families and paying taxes, and close family members who seek to rejoin immigrant workers who are either U.S. citizens or permanent residents.
All of these reforms would promote traditional American values such as diligence, hard work, family unity and putting down roots. These reforms would allow Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and Haitians to apply for document status just as already has been done for Cubans and Nicaraguans; allow undocumented workers of good character who have resided in the U.S. many years to apply for documented status; allow those who have lost their status as legal residents, but remain eligible to become permanent residents, to remain in the U.S. while seeking to regain their status; and help reduce family backlogs by providing more visas for close family members of citizens and permanent residents. Immigration laws establish the legal framework that allows Congress and the courts to control the flow of immigrants and legal aliens into the United States.
But the indomitable human spirit doesn't first hire a lawyer before fleeing a situation it finds intolerable and getting on a raft or swimming a river to freedom and opportunity in America. As Ronald Reagan reminded us in speaking of the Statue of Liberty's torch, "The glistening hope of that lamp is still ours.
Every promise, every opportunity is still golden in this land.
And through that golden door our children can walk into tomorrow with the knowledge that no one can be denied the promise that is America." The fact is, in a land as free and open as ours, there always will be more people who want to enter than we can accommodate under our laws.
That is a profound vote of confidence in the American dream. And just as surely, there always will be a certain percentage who succeed in forging a life in the U.S. and assimilate into our society sufficiently to become, after many years here, "citizens" in all but name -- what one might think of as "common-law" citizens -- as much citizens of this land as were many of our immigrant forefathers.
These true stakeholders in America deserve a chance to gain full citizenship status, and that obliges us to review and adjust our laws on occasion to make that possible.
To do anything less is to dim Liberty's lamp.

Quest for more foreign high-tech workers runs into hurdle

WASHINGTON -- Clinton administration officials complicated a high-tech industry push for access to more foreign workers yesterday when they said an 18-month-old law to protect U.S. technology workers has not been implemented. "This is a horror," said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. The disclosures came during a hearing before the House immigration subcommittee on efforts to expand the H-1B visa program.
High-tech employers have turned to the program with greater frequency in recent years to recruit foreign tech workers for their U.S. plants. In October 1998, Congress enacted a law tightening requirements on businesses to recruit U.S. workers before hiring foreign workers and barring employers from laying off U.S. workers and replacing them with foreign workers. But, 18 months later, it remains unclear when the new regulatory protections will be in place, said officials with the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Labor Department. "I am appalled," said subcommittee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas. Nonetheless, some expansion of the foreign visa program is expected this year. OMB administrator John T. Spotila defended the delays. "Achieving a proper balance between the needs of U.S. workers and those of U.S. businesses has been an important focus of administration policy," Spotila said. San Diego giant Qualcomm and other high-tech employers have pressed Congress to expand the H-1B program to offset what they say is a shortage of U.S. high-tech workers. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill sponsored by Smith that would allow an unlimited number of H-1B visas between 2001 and 2002. The current annual cap of 115,000 was reached several months ago.

Congress OKs more visas for high-tech talent

WASHINGTON -- High-tech companies could bring in almost 600,000 additional skilled foreign workers over the next three years under a bill that sped through Congress yesterday.
The Senate passed the bill on a 96-1 vote, and the House followed with voice vote passage several hours later, abandoning a version of its own that met serious opposition from the technology industry.
The quick congressional action after nine months of jockeying fulfills an election-year promise by both Democratic and Republican leaders to a high-tech sector that is increasingly flexing its political muscle through lobbying and campaign donations to both parties.  President Clinton has said he will sign it.
"We should pass the bill just as it is, so we don't have to conference it," said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.  "It's the best bill that's been considered yet."
Lofgren had co-sponsored a similar bill with Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif.  Their bill had stalled in the House in favor of a version that had more protections for American high-tech workers.
That version, by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, was approved by the House Judiciary Committee and would have required employers to pay the immigrants at least $40,000 a year and not use them to replace Americans on their payrolls.  Companies also would have to document that they had at least $250,000 in capital to participate in the program.
The industry opposed Smith's bill.
With U.S. unemployment rates holding steady near a 30-year low, companies in California's Silicon Valley and along other booming high-tech corridors say they need the additional workers with six-year H-1B visas to fuel their continuing rapid growth.
"The short-term problem is how to fill the key positions immediately so that we don't lose opportunities to foreign competitors or so that we don't force American businesses to move offshore to where skilled workers might live," said Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.
"In the short term this is good news for us," said Tony Chartrand, vice president of human resources for Ericsson's San Diego wireless unit.  "Longer term, it's not the ultimate solution."
Ericsson currently has about 200 of its 1,300 local employees under visas, which includes about 175 the company inherited when it took over Qualcomm's infrastructure unit in May 1999.
Chartrand said he doesn't expect that Ericsson will change its recruiting strategy, even with the boost in the quota.  Of the 200 workers the company typically hires each year, about 10 percent work under temporary visas, which have a maximum length of six years.
Qualcomm, another aggressive supporter of the expanded quota, welcomed the action.
"The company's success is built on the ability to attract and retain leading engineers from inside the United States and elsewhere," company spokeswoman Christine Trimble said.  "This legislation allows Qualcomm and other technology companies increased access to worldwide engineering talent."
Other industry advocates -- including Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers -- also praised yesterday's action.
"If we want the United States to maintain its technological advantage, employers must be allowed to hire the professionals they need," said Paula Collins, director of government relations for Texas Instruments.
Technology businesses have more than doubled their political contributions during the past two years, according to the independent Center for Responsive Politics.  The companies have given candidates $22.1 million since the start of last year, with Democrats getting a little more than half of that.
Computer software and other high-tech companies contend that 300,000 jobs are going unfilled for a lack of qualified workers.  Labor unions, however, argue that the companies want more immigrants so as to keep down wages of Americans holding the same jobs.
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., cast the lone vote against the bill.  Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., did not vote.
The bill allows the Immigration and Naturalization Service to issue up to 195,000 new H-1B visas annually for the next three years to skilled foreign workers.  The bill also would exempt from the cap foreign graduates of U.S. master's or doctoral programs or foreign workers at U.S. colleges, providing another source of labor to high-tech companies.
Exempted from the caps are foreign employees of universities and higher education research facilities.  But dropped from the legislation was language in an earlier version that would also have exempted from the ceilings foreign students with graduate degrees from U.S. universities who are subsequently hired by American high-tech companies.
Under present law, the government issued 115,000 H-1B visas during the fiscal year that ended Saturday.  With no new legislation the ceiling would fall to 107,500 this year and to 65,000 next year.
Democrats in both chambers said last week they will try to put other immigration measures, which had slowed consideration of the visa bill, on one of the spending bills that Congress must pass before adjourning for the year, under threat of a presidential veto.
The measures include granting amnesty to illegal immigrants who arrived in the United States before 1987 and offering permanent residency to more political refugees from Central America and Haiti.

John Moores deserves support of community
I cannot believe the hogwash being spoken about John Moores, owner of the San Diego Padres.  Since his arrival from Houston, this man has supported our city on so much more than just a baseball level.  I have heard and read of critics blasting him for contributing a huge amount of money into our school system.
How jaded are we as a city to believe that this man has only contributed this money to somehow further a political agenda?  Moores has nothing to gain by giving money to our schools.  Our children, on the other hand, reap the massive benefits of his generosity in the way of a better education.  As a parent, I thank him.
I also have heard and read the critics of the downtown ballpark, and I ask one simple question.  Who in their right mind would want that area to remain as it is?  The area is a mass of run-down old buildings that smell of human excrement.
By contrast, picture the revenue of a ballpark, the jobs it would open up for those who need them, as well as simple pride we would feel as a community by housing a major league club in a major league ballpark.  I cannot understand how we could not want this to happen.  Moores and Larry Lucchino have tried to better our city and have been personally and financially blasted for it.  Why?
Is it the fact that we already have Qualcomm Stadium and it is believed to be enough?  If we want the growth potential and financial gains of having a major league baseball club, we had better be prepared to act like a major league city.
The people of this wonderful city need to take an active and aggressive approach on this issue.  Moores needs to know that there are people in San Diego standing with him in his quest to better our city and are outraged that Bruce Henderson, specifically, continues to waste our time and money in throwing up these roadblocks.  I would imagine that if the opposition had to fund its own litigation, this would have been a very short-lived fight. ANDREA HOWELL Escondido
Credit for Milosevic's fall should go to Clinton
Re: "He's Gone, The end of the Milosevic era": (G-5, Oct. 15)
It is interesting that Ivo Daalder does not mention that President Clinton is principally responsible for the downfall of Slobodan Milosevic.  The president led our NATO allies in a bombing campaign that ended Milosevic's Hitler-like brutal ethnic cleansing.  This was accomplished without the loss of a single American life.
This was accomplished in spite of dire warnings that Milosevic's anti-aircraft capability was predicted to be far superior to Saddam Hussein's and that our pilots would be in jeopardy.  This was accomplished in spite of warnings by our military that we would not be able to stop Milosevic's genocide without a costly ground war.
This was accomplished in spite of the predictions of doom and gloom by the talking heads on radio talk shows, the TV and the press.

Immigrant visa bill will cause problems
The passage of the bill by Congress to increase the H-1B visas authorizing 190,000 new foreign high-tech workers per year to enter the workplace demonstrates that, when it's a choice between the average American's interests and those of deep-pocket industries, we lose.
The high-tech industry's vigorous opposition to the shelved Senate version, requiring an annual salary of $40,000 and stipulating that foreign workers could not be used to replace American workers, proves the intent is to import cheap foreign labor.  When jobs become scarce, and they will at some point, are the low-paid foreign workers going to be let go?  This is an ill-conceived, short-term fix, which will negatively impact future Americans.
In the next three years, almost 600,000 new workers will enter this country through this program.  Add to this family members, spouses and children, and it can easily reach 1.2 million.  That's about the population of San Diego.  The six-year limit is a joke.  Most of these will apply for permanent residence.
Probably the most immediate impact we can all relate to is sitting in our car, on our gridlocked freeways, smelling the aroma of countless exhausts, while we gaze at the sight of every available hill being graded flat for new housing.  San Diego, being one of the high-tech centers, can be assured of filling those houses.  One can only imagine what it will be like for our children and grandchildren. LILIANE LOUVET Escondido
SDSU alumni want Aztec mascot kept
One of the greatest traditions of San Diego is under attack.  If the citizens of San Diego County don't stand up and stop this attack, we will lose what few traditions we have.  I am talking about the Aztec tradition of San Diego State University.
Few things in society have ever received as much support as the retention of Monty Montezuma and the Aztec tradition.  If a poll were conducted and asked what color the sky is, it is doubtful that there would be as much consensus as there is on the Aztec mascot.
The SDSU Alumni Association sent out 12,000 e-mails asking whether the Aztec name should be kept.  Of the 4,000 responses received, 98 percent supported keeping the Aztec tradition as part of San Diego.  Due to that overwhelming support by the alumni, the Alumni Association resolved that the Aztec name, logo and human mascot should be kept.
With all this support, why is there still the possibility of Monty Montezuma becoming extinct?  Because a few students at San Diego State have called the Aztec tradition "racist" and "culturally degrading." That small group of students could not be further from the truth.  Ash Hayes, former president of the Alumni Association, said, "the Aztec tradition is based on honor, vigor, glory and heritage." That is truly what the Aztec tradition of SDSU is all about.
We must fight to keep that tradition of honor, vigor, glory and heritage alive. BILL HORN County Supervisor 5th District
Numerous comparisons have been made between SDSU and other schools with Indian mascots.  But SDSU is the only school to name a specific leader as the mascot.  Although I am somewhat ambivalent about the use of Aztecs as a nickname, I do feel regret over the flippant treatment of the noted leader Montezuma.
It is the statue of Montezuma that is objectionable.  Carved in 1937 by the famous artist Donal Hord, it has been widely praised for its artistic quality.  The artist originally named it "The Aztec," but the statue later assumed the label of Montezuma.  This was unfortunate because the facial features, particularly the nose and ears, have been exaggerated, possibly as a concession to the statue's role as a mascot.  It is doubtful that it bears any likeness to the subject.  I could understand why some native Aztecs might take offense.
Although the statue is a fine work of art in its own way, it has outlived its usefulness as "Montezuma." Perhaps this would be a good time to retire it, change it back to "The Aztec," or rename it "The San Diego State Aztec." MARC B. LOGAN San Diego
We support keeping the Aztec name and images as they stand, and find no grounds to consider them offensive or derogatory.  As a matter of fact, quite the opposite.
However, in the event of a decision to change, may we suggest a slot machine as mascot and logo.
This is, indeed, a symbol of cultural unity that would offend neither the dominant Anglo population nor the Native Americans.  They both love it.  It symbolizes the one element that has served to unify these former adversaries: money!  The two cultures appear to find self-aggrandizement honorable and respectable.  Certainly, in a capitalist society, students can aim no higher.
"San Diego State Slots" has a nice ring to it -- something all Native American students would support. MARK and RACHEL ALDRICH La Mesa

Following its overwhelming approval in Congress last month, President Clinton has signed into law a bill that will increase the number of temporary work visas INS officials can grant to skilled foreigners each year.
A majority of workers holding the "specialty occupation" H-1B visas are in the high-tech field.  The measure was a leading priority of tech executives across California who say the pool of qualified workers in the United States is simply not big enough to meet demand.
Increasing the number of visas granted to skilled foreigners may keep California's labor squeeze at bay for now.  But, by itself, visa expansion is no long-term solution.
In reality, the key pieces of California's skilled worker puzzle lie right at home.  California's colleges produced only about half the degrees needed by the state's labor market between 1970 and 1990 and imported the other half from out of state.  Such high levels of dependence on outside sources for skilled labor could have serious implications: California's high-tech industry is seeing growing competition from other areas of the country and other parts of the world, and the state is facing some serious quality-of-life issues that could deter skilled people from coming here.
One way to lower the risk of a future labor shortage is for California to commit itself to producing a larger share of its skilled work force.
A clear policy response is to expand support for the state's university and college system.  By increasing the capacity of the postsecondary school system to produce skilled labor, California will lower its reliance on other states and countries and increase the ability of young Californians to participate in rewarding occupations.
Encouragingly, significant strides have already been made in this area: The recent expansion of the CalGrant program, which guarantees tuition grant money to any student who meets grade and financial need requirements, is the boldest step this state has ever taken to increase college attendance among our youth.
At the same time that measures are taken to increase the number of young people who have access to higher education in California, the state must also take steps to ensure that more public university students enter high-tech majors.  It is a little-known fact that the cost of educating students in high-tech fields such as engineering and science often exceeds the student fees and state funding a campus receives.  Per-student subsidies from the state simply do not reflect the significantly higher costs of training students in these majors.  As a result, every single campus in the University of California system currently limits enrollment in "impacted majors" such as computer science.  In fact, seven out of eight UC campuses serving undergraduates have set enrollment limits for engineering and/or computer science, and six of eight campuses have set limits on biological sciences.
How sadly ironic that during a time of immense high-tech worker demand, California college students are regularly denied entry to high-tech majors due to rigid funding mechanisms.  The state should closely re-examine the level of support it provides the UC and Cal State systems so that any qualified student who wants to can enter these important fields of study.
In addition to expanding educational opportunities, we need to make meaningful efforts to preserve California's quality of life -- something we are seriously compromising.  Even if California begins to produce a healthier proportion of its skilled labor force, we will continue to need significant numbers of workers from other states and countries to support our economy.
How long can California continue to attract and retain highly skilled and educated workers despite soaring housing prices, agonizing traffic congestion, and alarming spikes in power prices?  Some of our most skilled workers come from other parts of the country.  To continue to attract these American workers, we must ensure that California cities like San Diego and San Jose remain as appealing places to live as Seattle, Arlington, Va. or Austin, Texas.
Additionally, although many foreigners have a strong desire to come to the United States and may focus less on quality of life issues, we shouldn't assume that the United States is the only choice these skilled workers have.  European countries like Germany and France, which are looking toward easing their rules on foreign workers, could become more tempting destinations.
Of course, the maddening irony in all this is that the thing we need -- more skilled labor -- is the very same thing fueling the population boom that threatens our quality of life.  The answer may be a three-pronged approach: a continued commitment to increasing temporary work visas for foreign workers, a dedicated effort to expanding the state's postsecondary educational systems to produce more of our own skilled labor force and a firm commitment to preserve our quality of life.

Imported know-how; When U.S. firms need help, they turn to India's high-tech hiring hall

Silicon Raj. That's Hindi for Silicon Kingdom.  It's what some wags call Silicon Valley these days -- a nod to the 200,000 or so Indians working in the cradle of American technology.
Over the last few years, Indian entrepreneurs have helped spawn such firms as Cirrus Logic, Sun Microsystems and Hotmail.  Indian engineers have filled the laboratories of IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft.
Due to their success in the high-tech arena, Fortune magazine recently rated Indians as America's most successful immigrants, since they have created companies worth a total of $235 billion.
"Indian entrepreneurs are doing very well in India and Silicon Valley," India's finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, said during a recent visit to Stanford.
But if San Jose is becoming Silicon Raj, San Diego County might someday become Wireless Raj, thanks to the growing number of Indians employed here.
One indication of the community's size came last month when The Indus Entrepreneur, an international Indian business association, inaugurated its local chapter.  The association drew about 300 executives, engineers and scientists to a meeting hall in La Jolla, far exceeding the organizers' expectations.
Indians have a firm footing in the area's high-tech firms, thanks partly to H-1B visas, which allow companies to import high-tech workers from overseas.  An estimated 300-400 Indian engineers work at Qualcomm.  Large contingents of Indians work in other labs.
The ranks are expected to swell if Congress expands the H-1B program.  Currently, Indians make up the largest number of H-1Bs, or 46 percent of the 650,000 or so H-1Bs working in the United States.
In a bill before Congress, the annual allotment of H-1Bs could increase from 115,000 to 200,000 per year, which could result in a proportionate number of new Indian emigres.
"Percentage-wise, there's probably an equal ratio of tech people in India and America, but since India has nearly a billion people, the number gets significant," says Raghu Sugavanam, founder of IndoPortals.Com in La Jolla.  The company creates Web sites for Indian computer users.
Last year, 183,000 high-tech engineers graduated from India's 1,230 technical colleges and universities.  Since opportunities are bleak in India -- the country has between 165,000 and 250,000 software positions -- the graduates look for work outside the country.
"From some schools, 60 percent of computer science or engineering graduates come to the United States," says Baljit Gai, a founder of The Indus Entrepreneur, or TIE chapter.  "Getting a degree from the Indian Institute of Technology (India's version of MIT) is like getting a green card."
Although the recent boom in Indian-owned businesses has thrown a spotlight on the Indian community, the immigration process is not new.
Business strategist C.K. Prahalad, who coined the phrase "core competencies," notes that the first wave arrived 30 years ago, when such Fortune 500 companies as General Motors and Ford began tapping the Indian Institute of Technology, or IIT, for engineering talent.
That wave of immigrants gradually landed leading positions in engineering schools or high-tech companies.
Prahalad, who recently bought a house in Rancho Santa Fe, was among the first wave, arriving in the United States in the early 1970s to study at Harvard, then to teach at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
Baljit Gai, Raghu Sugavanam and Prahalad's business partner, Ramesh Jain, were among the Indians who moved to the United States during the same period.
A former professor at IIT, Jain is one of San Diego's most successful Indian entrepreneurs.  Jain came to this country to teach electrical and computer engineering, first at Ann Arbor and then at the University of California San Diego.
As a pioneer in artificial intelligence, Jain shifted easily from academia to the business world.  In 1990, he launched Imageware, specializing in virtual modeling and reverse engineering.  After selling Imageware, he created Virage, which develops visual-information systems.
Although Virage is now based in San Mateo, Jain launched it from his home in San Diego, assisted by five UCSD students.  When it went public last month, its stock jumped from an opening of $11 per share to the $20 range.
Jain's current project is Praja, which offers such products as a program that lets sports fans construct their own football highlights on the computer.
Prahalad, chairman of Praja, says Jain's story is typical of that first wave of Indian immigrants.  "They established a good base, and now we're seeing the next generation build on that strength," he says.
In fact, Praja is giving other Indians a boost by hiring Indian engineers.  About 10 of Praja's 60 employees in Sorrento Valley come from India, thanks in part to the H-1B visa.  Jain says that without such visas, he would be hard-pressed to find skilled workers in San Diego County, where the jobless rate for engineers hovers around 1 or 2 percent.
Baljit Gai, a TIE executive, sees a downside to such massive immigration, however.  "India spends an enormous amount of money to educate people and once they get the education, they just leave," he sighs.
Not everyone in the Indian community shares that view.
Paula Chakravartty, assistant professor of communication at UCSD, notes that Indian emigres send billions of dollars to their homeland each year.  C.K. Prahalad adds that the chief benefit to India is brainpower.
"If only a small portion of the knowledge being accrued in the United States trickles back to India, it's better than any money," Prahalad says.  "You can expect to see a lot of products being developed in India."
Many of those products may be developed under the auspices of Indian-owned companies in the United States.
Praja, for instance, recently signed a contract with Complete Business Solutions India to handle some of its programming at a 300-worker plant in Bangalore, India's version of Silicon Valley.
IndoPortals maintains a work crew in Bangalore.  Burning Glass, which develops artificial-intelligence programs for the employment industry, has a small team in India handling much of its data inputting.
"The 12-hour time difference allows them to work while we're asleep," says Krishna Gopinathan, the co-founder of Burning Glass and a Canadian of Indian descent.
Of course, a key attraction in India is the low pay scale.  Engineers that make $100,000 in the United States might be paid $10,000 in India, which draws such firms as Motorola and Ericsson to its shores.
Supporters of the H-1B program wield India's low salaries as a club against critics, saying that if companies cannot bring foreign workers to the United States, they will hire them at a much lower rate in their native lands.
But the shift to India has already begun.  Thanks largely to contracts from foreign companies, software exports from India are increasing 60 percent per year.  This year, India is projected to export $3.9 billion in software, with 60 percent headed for the United States.
Technology already is changing India.  Family farmers are selling milk via the Internet.  In the cities, people are ordering movie tickets or buying pizza over the Web. Though only 1 in 100 people can afford a computer, they can rent time from somebody who has one.
"There's a tremendous amount of feeling in India that computers will deliver people from poverty to riches," Prahalad says.

In 1990, he launched Imageware, specializing in virtual modeling and reverse engineering.
After selling Imageware, he created Virage, which develops visual-information systems. Although Virage is now based in San Mateo, Jain launched it from his home in San Diego, assisted by five UCSD students.
When it went public last month, its stock jumped from an opening of $11 per share to the $20 range. Jain's current project is Praja, which offers such products as a program that lets sports fans construct their own football highlights on the computer. Prahalad, chairman of Praja, says Jain's story is typical of that first wave of Indian immigrants.
"They established a good base, and now we're seeing the next generation build on that strength," he says. In fact, Praja is giving other Indians a boost by hiring Indian engineers. About 10 of Praja's 60 employees in Sorrento Valley come from India, thanks in part to the H-1B visa.
Jain says that without such visas, he would be hard-pressed to find skilled workers in San Diego County, where the jobless rate for engineers hovers around 1 or 2 percent. Baljit Gai, a TIE executive, sees a downside to such massive immigration, however.
"India spends an enormous amount of money to educate people and once they get the education, they just leave," he sighs. Not everyone in the Indian community shares that view. Paula Chakravartty, assistant professor of communication at UCSD, notes that Indian emigres send billions of dollars to their homeland each year. C.K. Prahalad adds that the chief benefit to India is brainpower. "If only a small portion of the knowledge being accrued in the United States trickles back to India, it's better than any money," Prahalad says. "You can expect to see a lot of products being developed in India." Many of those products may be developed under the auspices of Indian-owned companies in the United States. Praja, for instance, recently signed a contract with Complete Business Solutions India to handle some of its programming at a 300-worker plant in Bangalore, India's version of Silicon Valley. IndoPortals maintains a work crew in Bangalore.
Burning Glass, which develops artificial-intelligence programs for the employment industry, has a small team in India handling much of its data inputting. "The 12-hour time difference allows them to work while we're asleep," says Krishna Gopinathan, the co-founder of Burning Glass and a Canadian of Indian descent. Of course, a key attraction in India is the low pay scale.
Engineers that make $100,000 in the United States might be paid $10,000 in India, which draws such firms as Motorola and Ericsson to its shores. Supporters of the H-1B program wield India's low salaries as a club against critics, saying that if companies cannot bring foreign workers to the United States, they will hire them at a much lower rate in their native lands. But the shift to India has already begun.
Thanks largely to contracts from foreign companies, software exports from India are increasing 60 percent per year.
This year, India is projected to export $3.9 billion in software, with 60 percent headed for the United States. Technology already is changing India.
Family farmers are selling milk via the Internet.
In the cities, people are ordering movie tickets or buying pizza over the Web. Though only 1 in 100 people can afford a computer, they can rent time from somebody who has one. "There's a tremendous amount of feeling in India that computers will deliver people from poverty to riches," Prahalad says.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND; For San Diego businesses, tight labor market puts a premium on hiring and keeping help

Last summer, the owner of a small hotel in North County was complaining about not being able to hire a front-desk clerk.
He had been paying $6.50 an hour a year previously and had no trouble filling the job.  Now he was advertising the same job for $10 an hour.  His phone hardly rang at all.
"It's frustrating," he says.  "I don't want to pay someone $12 or $13 an hour for this job, but it might take that to get someone good."
Welcome to the world of work in San Diego County in 2000. Labor is scarce, and experienced, competent people who are looking for work know that.
And, although companies have been slow to acknowledge it, the message is finally getting through that good workers are at a premium.
Unemployment in San Diego County likely will end 2000 right at the 3 percent mark, according to the state Employment Development Department.  That's a historic low for the region and less than half what it was in 1995.
That shrinking pool of available labor seems to be having an impact throughout the economy.
John DeWitt, vice president of Lee Hecht Harrison, a career services firm, says the region's employers have pushed hiring up a couple of notches on their to-do lists.
"There seems to be a realization that hiring is more difficult," he says, and since firms can't do a good job without the right people, they had "better pay more attention to how (they) handle that." That realization has streamlined some recruiting and hiring processes.
"We're seeing major corporations making more and more hiring decisions the day people come in to interview," DeWitt says.
Concerned that there are other jobs waiting for good workers, some companies will tender a job offer on the spot.
"Resumes now get looked at the moment they come in," DeWitt says.  "If a company is interested, (it will) call that person to schedule an interview within 24 hours.  This seems to have come from the realization that a good person is going to have multiple job opportunities."
Unemployment hasn't reached 4 percent in more than three years in San Diego County, creating a sustained competition for talent that ripples through all levels of the job market.
Nowhere is that more evident than in the high-tech sector.  Throughout the 1990s, the growth of technology companies has propelled the region's economy.
But, strapped by a shortage of qualified technical workers and a rapidly expanding field, high-tech firms are feeling the employment pinch more than many other companies. needs
In San Diego County, technology companies estimate the unemployment rate for engineers is less than 1 percent, with some of those holding outdated skills.
That has strained plans for growth at many companies and fueled a debate over allowing more work visas for foreign workers under the federal government's H-1B program.
One report estimated that from 1970 to 1990, California universities and colleges awarded only half the degrees necessary for the state's burgeoning high-tech work force.  That inability to keep up with the demands of business meant California companies either had to import foreign workers or slow down growth.
This fall, President Clinton signed legislation to admit 195,000 foreign workers annually for the next three years under the H-1B visa program.
In fiscal 2000, the United States already had granted 115,000 such visas and without the legislation that number was to have declined over the next few years.
The tight labor market is reaching into other sectors, too.
Phil Blair, co-owner of Manpower Temporary Services, says a manufacturer raised pay for temporary assembly-line help this fall from $6.25 an hour to $7 and is considering an increase to $7.50 early in 2001.
"This employer placed a large order with us and I couldn't do it," Blair says.  "I told them that these workers could get more from other employers, and I couldn't in good conscience steer them to the lower-paying company." wage gains
In October, the state agreed to raise its minimum wage 50 cents to $6.25 an hour on Jan. 1. That will be followed with an additional 50 cents an hour on Jan. 1, 2002. The increase in minimum wage is expected to affect about 1 million Californians.
Blair is aware of what a dramatic bump in pay schedules could mean:
The $7 an hour worker will want $8, the $10 an hour worker will want $12 and so on.  "You see wages go up like this, and you know that inflation can't be far behind," he says.
Meanwhile, in the rush to fill jobs, some employers are reviewing their hiring criteria.
A company might now accept six months of experience, rather than hold out for a year, or maybe it will be satisfied with someone's ability to take directions in English rather than possess fluency in English.
"Employers seem willing to re-think what they are demanding these days," Blair says.
For now, large salary increases and signing bonuses are being offered for many key jobs.  In addition, some firms employing temporary workers are offering attendance bonuses of $50 for not missing a single workday over a month, or $250 for not missing a day of work during the quarter.
"Keeping good employees in this market is as big an issue as finding them," DeWitt says.  "If you lose two good people along the way, have you really gained anything?
"You don't want to lose a good worker if you're not sure you can replace them.  That's why at the professional level we see a lot of people being offered counteroffers to remain with their company.  Companies know that it's financially beneficial to hand out a raise rather than go looking for another difficult-to-find worker."

Does America really need even more foreign workers?

Almost every employer seems to be clamoring for temporary foreign workers these days.
In fact, many high-tech computer and electronics firms have been pressuring Congress to increase the quota of H1B visas that would allow foreign workers to come to the U.S. for up to three years. Under this arrangement, the employer pays a fee and then is allowed to hire an engineer or programmer or some other skilled worker, from out of the country, to work in their company for a limited time. Here's the rub.
They often replace existing workers at reduced wages, and in many cases, do not hire older or newly graduated, prospective employees. This practice has done wonders for the corporate bottom line and these foreign workers are literally chained to their desk.
In many cases, they are forced to work long hours without overtime pay and usually do not receive benefits offered to permanent employees. In addition, they are forced to stay with one employer for up to three years, without the ability to shop for a better-paying job.
It's the nearest thing to involuntary servitude. Is there a dire need for these foreign high-tech workers?
Not according to Norman Matloff, professor of computer technology at University of California at Davis.
Matloff has been tracking high-tech computer jobs for years, and he has repeatedly decried the so-called dire need for these foreign workers. According to Matloff, there are ample qualified applicants for most of the jobs filled by the foreign workers.
He cites a bumper crop of newly graduated engineers and many seasoned workers over 40 who are having difficulty landing jobs in the youth-oriented computer industry.
Matloff also points to the fact that many high-tech and dot-com companies are facing tough times in the current market and are unable to increase their work force in a slowing market. There are several bills before Congress that would increase the current limit of 115,000 visas to as many as 200,000. In fact, one bill offered by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chairman of the immigration subcommittee, has been approved by that committee.
It would offer an unlimited number of potential foreign workers.
The industry favors another bill co-authored by Reps. David Dreier, R-Covina and Zoe Lofrgen, D-San Jose, that would allow nearly 200,000 workers.
They prefer this bill over the open-ended Smith bill because it does not provide the job protection for American workers, required under Smith's bill. On top of the hundreds of thousands of foreign workers for high-tech industries, farmers are clamoring for more field hands under a similar plan that is fashioned after the bracero program, which was ended in the 1960s. It was opposed by the labor unions and many pro-immigrant groups, due to poor treatment of the workers and barely-habitable housing conditions.
The net result of the bracero program was that huge numbers of illegal immigrants decided to remain in the United States.
This created a demand for the amnesty of 1986, in which 3.1 million illegal immigrants received legal status. The law provided stiff penalties for employers who knowingly hired illegal immigrants. It was also supposed to beef up the border to stop more illegals from entering the country.
The problem was that the law was not enforced until immigration reform legislation passed in 1996. In addition to the demand for foreign workers, the Clinton administration wants to add an amnesty for up to 500,000 illegal immigrants now living in the United States.
This amnesty would cover Central Americans who came to this country during the war in El Salvador, Guatemala and Haiti under asylum laws. The problem is that once they got here, they refused to go home at the end of the war.
This is contrary to our immigration laws and would allow them to circumvent the long wait for legal entry. Therein lies the problem.
If we give amnesty to this group, it would be a signal to the impoverished around the world that if you can get across our border, you're home free and will be given legal status sooner or later.
It would also penalize those who have patiently waited for legal entry.
When the U.S. government granted amnesty in 1986, it was supposed to stop illegal immigration. In fact, the exact opposite has resulted.
Today, the Immigration and Naturalization Service admits that 6 million illegal aliens are residing in the country.
Some say the figure is as high 10 million or more. If the Clinton administration and pro-business Republicans get their way, we might as well scrap any semblance of an effective immigration policy. The H1B program must be carefully administered to prevent the fraud that has been documented in the past, and there cannot be a general amnesty if America is to retain any semblance of control over its borders.
America must control immigration in order to slow the runaway population explosion.

The 2000 presidential election will go down in history as a time when razor-thin margins tested antiquated voting systems, our judicial process, the U.S. Constitution and, most certainly, the patience of the American people.
For some entrepreneurs in the New Economy, the elections also signaled a growing trend in which political candidates staked a claim to the high-tech industry and promised to help it prosper. Candidates in both parties helped to advance some issues for the New Economy in the last Congress and have pledged more support over the next few years.
For the most part, however, they have focused on the "e" (as in electronic) when they should be focusing more on the "p" (as in people). While taxation of the Internet and the binding effect of electronic signatures are certainly important public policy issues, the most critical issue facing entrepreneurs is more profound.
It is whether America's entrepreneurs can find the people -- technicians, salespeople and managers -- to build and grow new companies and create jobs. The National Commission on Entrepreneurship recently asked 250 entrepreneurs to identify the primary challenge to starting and growing a new company.
Without exception, finding and keeping good people ranked at the top of the list.
Te participants in the study came from both dot-com and "bricks and mortar" companies, showing that the struggle to hire capable employees affects WalMart and Seven-Eleven as much as high-tech companies.
In addition, a group of San Diego entrepreneurs who participated in the study said the shortage of quality workers has driven up both salaries and benefits. The 106th Congress did take an important step forward when, at the end of the session, it passed legislation to raise the cap on H-1B visas.
These temporary visas for highly skilled foreign workers are a critical component to solving the worker shortage. Both the Congress and the outgoing president are to be congratulated for addressing this pressing issue for entrepreneurs and for the economy.
Yet the 200,000 employees who will enter the country under this program will make only a small dent in the problem. With so many companies scrambling for the same talent, it is likely that many jobs for skilled high-tech workers will go unfilled.
Right now SAIC's telecommunications subsidiary Telcordia Technologies has 1,400 unfilled positions available, and it is unlikely that Telcordia will be able to fill these jobs from the small H-1B visa pool. The work-force shortage is not limited to skilled workers.
There also is a shortage of entry-level workers who have the communications and problem-solving skills necessary to serve customers and conduct basic business tasks.
Entrepreneurial companies can train new employees in specific technologies for their businesses, but they are not equipped to provide remedial education in fundamental skills.
Educational institutions, government, and entrepreneurs should work together to prepare more young people for all types of jobs -- many of which are increasingly technical. The war for talent, however, cannot be won by better education alone.
It also is important to provide incentives for employees to want to stay with an organization. Programs such as telework, where employees spend some amount of time working remotely, can be a boon to employee morale and retention.
Studies indicate that telework programs are responsible for a 20 percent increase in employee productivity. Also, revised tax laws could help firms expand employee ownership through stock options.
There are a few proposals brought before the last Congress, and certain to be reintroduced, that would create a "super stock option," combining the best of these options' advantages to both employers and employees.
These proposals should be seriously considered as ways to increase employee ownership and entrepreneurship. Most importantly, policy-makers need to recognize the role entrepreneurs play in our economy.
Their innovative products and services improve the quality of our lives, create new jobs, make the United States more competitive abroad, and help create economic growth and wealth. Our elected leaders need to enact policies that promote entrepreneurship so that economic expansion in San Diego and elsewhere across the country can continue.
We are counting on the new Congress and administration to promote our entrepreneurial economy.

A need for foreign-born professionals
The San Diego Union-Tribune
September 24, 2000, Sunday

Section: OPINION;Pg. G-3; OP ED COLUMN.
Length: 921 words

Body

The H-1B program is a prompt, lawful way for U.S. employers to hire foreign-born professionals (such as engineers and computer programmers) on a temporary basis.  This program allows U.S. businesses to recruit and hire the best-qualified candidates from around the world and compete on a level playing field with foreign companies in such key industries as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and education.
The issue before Congress is whether the number of H-1B visas granted by the U.S. government should be raised from current levels, and if so, should Congress limit the use of the H-1B program by placing additional restrictions on employers and companies.
Holders of H-1B visas are foreign professionals hired on a temporary basis by U.S. employers.  They can only be hired for "specialty occupations," which are defined under the law as jobs that require a professional who has the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in their field of specialty.  Examples are doctors, engineers, professors, accountants, researchers, medical personnel and computer professionals.
The subject of H-1B visas was most recently addressed by Congress in the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA). The ACWIA increased the number of H-1B visas to be granted beginning in 1999. According to the ACWIA, no more than 115,000 visas would be granted for each Fiscal Year 1999 and 2000, 107,500 in 2001, and 65,000 after that.  ACWIA also added new requirements for employers who use a higher percentage of H-1B workers, such as requiring high-use companies to first recruit in the United States, and not lay off American workers before using the H-1B program.
ACWIA also stiffened the punishments for companies that violate the law.  The new punishments include fines of up to $35,000, a three-year bar from participating in visa programs, and repaying salaries of any underpaid foreign professionals.  ACWIA further requires employers to pay a fee of $500 per visa to fund education and training programs for U.S. workers.
U.S. employers use the H-1B program to hire foreign professionals with highly needed skills.  Employers typically hire H-1B professionals for three reasons:
[] Needed skills: To obtain essential skills or rare and unique knowledge;
[] Global market expertise: For their special expertise in overseas needs, markets, trends or distribution, allowing U.S. businesses to compete in global markets;
[] Temporary shortages: To fill temporary shortages of needed skills.  If American companies are prevented from hiring essential people to fill critical positions, an increasing number of jobs dependent upon these positions will go unfilled each year, resulting in American jobs being lost and American projects losing out to foreign competition.  As the U.S. economy becomes increasingly global, H-1B professionals become ever more essential to San Diego's continued economic growth.
Larry Fitch, president and chief executive officer of San Diego Workforce Partnership, Inc., states, "The only way we will be able to permanently resolve the issue of importing workers for high technology positions is by growing our own work force.  This will require a major commitment to and investment in our youth.  Unfortunately, this is a long-term solution, and the crisis is now.  We must continue to use H-1B visas in the short term, and ensure that we are accessing the training dollars that are available with the visas to upgrade the skills of our current workers."
ACWIA increased the number of temporary visas through fiscal year 2001, while making significant changes to the program to enhance domestic work-force protections.  However, the increases mandated in ACWIA were insufficient; the H-1B visa cap was reached well before the end of Fiscal Year 1999 and was reached in March in Fiscal Year 2000.
Kim Giannone, Employment Specialist, Insight Electronics LLC says, "We firmly support an increase, and even the removal of the limit on H-1Bs. We are an international company, and we have problems filling our technical and engineering positions in all areas.  It is very difficult (if not impossible) for us to fill our openings with the available U.S. workers."
Among other things, the legislation before Congress would accomplish the following:
[] Increase the H-1B visa cap to 200,000 or more for each year for the period FY 2000-2003.
[] Exempt from the H-1B visa cap non-immigrants employed by higher educational institutions and research institutions, and foreign graduates of U.S. masters and doctoral degree programs sponsored by U.S. employers within six months of their graduation.
[] Permit extensions of H-1B status past the six-year limit for H-1B beneficiaries who have immigrant visa applications pending.
Raising the H-1B visa limitation will have an immediate and significant impact on the San Diego economy.  San Diego is one of the fastest growing regions in the country in the high-tech, biotechnology and research industries.  San Diego also is home for hundreds of start-up companies and relatively small businesses.  These industries have the greatest demand for the H-1B program.
San Diego employers use the H-1B program to obtain skilled foreign professionals at a time when unemployment is at an all-time low and competition for skilled technical workers is at an all-time high.  Increasing the H-1B visa cap without imposing restrictions on employers would greatly enhance the growth of such companies as well as encourage increased investment into the San Diego region.

Growing issue; Farmers see a labor crunch, field hands don't, as chances of guest-worker legislation improve
The San Diego Union-Tribune

Dateline: CALEXICO 
Body


CALEXICO -- By 4:30 a.m. most mornings, as many as 10,000 people are huddled on the street corners and in the parking lots of this small downtown, hoping to be hired for work in the fields. But when the employers' vans and buses pull away, scores of men and women are routinely left behind -- another day without work. This scene at the gateway to the Imperial Valley, America's winter salad bowl, happened time and again in January.
Workers far exceeded jobs, just as they routinely do in fruit- and vegetable-growing regions throughout the United States.
It's an impression bolstered by high unemployment rates in farming regions, with Imperial County's among the highest at 23 percent. Across the country in the nation's capital, however, a contradictory story is told. Farm owners are complaining to Congress of a serious labor shortage.
The only solution, they say, is a new guest-worker program that would allow them to temporarily hire foreigners. But if growers can't find enough people to harvest their fields, why are unemployment rates so high in agricultural communities?
Why is there a labor shortage amid a labor surplus? Conflicting answers to these questions have been offered for decades, as guest-worker legislation has been introduced in Congress -- and voted down. This year, however, guest-worker legislation is gaining new momentum. When President Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox met this month, they formed a high-level team charged, among other things, with producing a guest-worker plan. Both presidents believe that such a program would help stem illegal immigration and protect Mexican workers in the United States. "The sense I've got is, this is the year if we can put the right plan together," said Bob Vice, a Fallbrook grower who as president of the National Council of Agricultural Employers leads the lobbying effort.
The organization represents three-quarters of the country's farm employers. Imperial County contract harvester Steve Scaroni points to his own situation as an example of why a guest-worker program is needed. Every day, his buses load up workers in a Calexico parking lot.
And even though thousands of people are there looking for work, he says that in the past two months his crews have been shorthanded by 5 to 50 percent. Scaroni offered explanations for why there appear to be more workers than jobs most mornings. "They probably don't want to work in the first place.
Or they're very selective about what jobs they'll do," he said.
"A lot come for the socializing, to see their friends." Scaroni also notes that field jobs, which pay slightly more or less than California's minimum wage of $6.25 an hour, aren't as attractive as other entry-level jobs, like construction. Picking fruit and vegetables is physically draining, and people quickly switch to better-paying, year-round positions. But there's little hard evidence to back up the growers' claim of a labor shortage. The California Employment Development Department "doesn't have anything that documents a labor shortage" in farm communities, said an agency spokeswoman. In fact, some of the state's highest unemployment rates in December were in agricultural regions -- the 23 percent in Imperial County, 14 percent in Fresno and Madera counties, 12 percent in Monterey County, 11 percent in Kern County, 9 percent in San Joaquin County. The national unemployment rate, meanwhile, was 4 percent. After the harvest, the rates soar even higher in agricultural regions.
In July, Imperial County's rate was 34 percent. The Employment Development Department's director, Michael Bernick, points out that many of the people collecting unemployment wouldn't be suited for field work. But he also said that California's agricultural community tends to bypass the state employment system, turning instead to informal hiring networks like the morning gatherings in downtown Calexico. Even Fallbrook grower Vice admits there's no proof of labor shortages. "But it's been tight," he adds quickly, noting that employers are going to great lengths to fill their crews.
Some offer incentives, such as paying part of the wages up front, he said.
Others accept less-qualified applicants, including those who seem drunk. Outside the Donut Avenue cafe in Calexico, a number of workers staked their own position in the debate. Raul Rubio said he's never seen a labor shortage in the 22 years he's worked in Imperial Valley and Yuma fields, and he's not seeing one now. "They're lying," he said, shaking a finger to make his point.
"The wages wouldn't be so low if there weren't enough workers." o o o The strongest argument for a new guest-worker program is its promise of changing the illicit system that has grown up over the past five decades. Illegal immigrants make up more than half of the current U.S. crop work force of 1.8 million, creating an apartheid underclass that has woven itself into the U.S. agricultural industry. Every year, 150,000 immigrants enter illegally, knowing that if they can make it across the border they can find work, often in the fields.
Each year, 300 to 400 people die of exposure, dehydration or abusive treatment during the journey. Once in the United States, many are reluctant to return home because of high smugglers' fees and tight border security.
They live furtive existences, ever vigilant to detection. Some 50,000 farm workers come to the United States legally each year through a small existing agricultural guest-worker program called H-2A. But growers complain that H-2A requires cumbersome proof that workers are needed, then can't deliver them in time to do the work.
They'd prefer a program modeled after the H-1B guest-worker program that has allowed U.S. technology firms to import more than a half million high-tech workers since 1990. The growers' arguments are compelling: [] Foreign workers could come here safely, earn legal U.S. wages and be freed from a life of hiding and exploitation. [] The influx of undocumented workers would slow, saving the U.S. government much of the $1 billion spent annually on border control. [] Employers could stop pretending they don't hire illegals.
And a blow would be dealt to counterfeiters who sell false documents to field workers. Such arguments have gained the growers unusual allies, including the United Farm Workers union.
Its president, Arturo Rodriguez, said the union and the growers have spent years coming to terms on the subject. "I tend to disagree with the industry that there's a real need and a real shortage of workers," Rodriguez said.
"But we have been clear that the only way we'll accept a guest-worker program is if workers' wages are protected, that housing is protected, that some type of transportation is protected and also that if there is a problem they can have somewhere to go for help." But guest-worker programs, wherever they have been implemented, often fall short of the lofty ideas that preceded them. The previous U.S. experience with such an arrangement -- the controversial "bracero" program that lasted from the end of World War II to the mid-1960s -- was rife with abuse and fraud. And when the bracero workers told friends and family about their U.S. earnings, Mexicans without documents also began coming to the United States, establishing an ongoing pattern of illegal migration. "No program like this could ever be implemented without triggering a new massive wave of immigration," said Dan Stein, director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR.
"The growers want cheap labor, but society ends up with needy people." Other countries also have found that guest workers become permanent residents. Of the Turks recruited to work in Germany from the 1950s to 1970s, about half stayed on. And 15 percent of the approximately 15,000 Mexicans recruited each year in a Canadian guest-worker program fail to return home.
Among those who participate five or more years, the number climbs to 50 percent. Guest-worker programs can also restrict individual freedoms. "The worker is dependent on the employer to get a visa for the next year," said Bruce Goldstein, co-director of the Farmworker Justice Fund. "This puts them in a very vulnerable economic status (that) prevents many from asking for wage increases or challenging unfair employment practices. It also denies workers the democratic freedoms this country was based on." o o o Two guest-worker measures are taking shape. One is being prepared by agricultural employers, with the backing of the United Farm Workers and some immigration advocacy groups. The other is being developed by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who wrote the H-1B high-tech measure, but helped kill last year's farm guest-worker bill. Gramm and four other U.S. senators traveled to Mexico City last month to discuss their ideas with President Fox. Both plans would authorize temporary use of foreigner workers in the United States.
They differ greatly, however, on recruitment, wages and housing, and on what Mexico's role should be. Some of the growers want to tap workers from countries other than Mexico. "I'd probably skip to El Salvador because they are great people and hard workers," said Scaroni, the Imperial Valley contractor. The growers also would give guest workers the right to someday live permanently in the United States.
Under Gramm's plan, they could not. The most controversial element of Gramm's plan offers guest-worker status first to undocumented immigrants already in the United States.
When the visas they would be granted expired, however, they'd have to go home and reapply to return. "The intent would be to assure employers weren't turning away Americans," said Gramm's press secretary, Larry Neal.
"It will not be a revival of the old bracero program, nor will it be an amnesty program that invites people to come to stay." Last year's bill, Neal said, "was something like serfdom and it ended with amnesty.
And Senator Gramm is opposed to both serfdom and amnesty." To agricultural employers, the most important issue in any new legislation is who would determine when workers are needed -- who, in effect, can open the gate. Under the growers' proposal, they would merely notify the government that they need field hands.
That way, they say, they could streamline the process and get workers in time for harvests so crops wouldn't rot in the fields. The growers strongly oppose Gramm's suggestion that employers be required to exhaust local unemployment rolls before hiring guest workers. Vice, who contends that few people on unemployment are qualified for field work, said, "Under that system, we'd have a hard time getting any workers at all." o o o Imperial County is rare among U.S. agricultural regions in that its growers already have access to a huge group of foreign workers who cross the border legally each day from Mexicali. At the peak of the 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. commute, as many as 5,000 Mexicans walk through the pedestrian gates each hour.
They have U.S.-issued permits, which allow them to work days in the United States and go home to Mexico at night. But even with this abundance of workers, Imperial Valley growers are leading the call for more foreign workers. Agricultural experts are split on whether a guest-worker program would resolve this paradox.
They agree, however, that the likelihood of Congress passing a new guest-worker program has never been stronger. "What we have that is different is a president in Mexico who recognizes the problem in Mexico and wants to fix it," said Gramm spokesman Neal.
"And fortunately we have a president in Washington who also recognizes the problem and wants to fix it."

Suzanne Hunt has an ambition.  She wants to work with patients who are undergoing clinical trials, which are experimental studies to treat or prevent disease.
There is, however, a catch: the IDEC clinical research assistant, who graduated a couple of years ago from UC Irvine with a bachelor's degree in biology, didn't have the specific skills or on-the-job experience required to work with this special group of patients.
Not to be deterred, Suzanne enrolled in a professional certificate program in Clinical Trials Design and Management at UCSD Extension.  There, she learned the clinical trials' process and obtained the knowledge and training she needs to move ahead in a rewarding career.
This is one small example of how communication and cooperation between educators and employers can convert specialized training and development needs into enhanced job skills.  Still, it's just the start.
Two ominous trends -- the growing demand for high-tech visas and the large proportion of non-college-bound high school graduates -- indicate we need to do a better job training and developing employees and educating students for high-skilled jobs in San Diego now and in the decade ahead.
In the regional biotech and high-tech industries high-skilled workers are in short supply and their scarcity is expected to increase.  Companies would prefer to hire local workers but are often forced to recruit job candidates from other states or foreign countries.
IDEC, which signed an agreement in September to develop a world-class manufacturing and research and development campus in Oceanside, will seek to hire qualified personnel locally for the new facility when construction is completed in the next three or four years.  But if recent experience is any indication, we may have to look abroad to fill key management positions.  Recently, we had to recruit new managers from as far away as Germany and Argentina, and IDEC is not alone with this problem.
"Currently, 10 percent of the 153,000 biotech employees in the United States are H-1B visa holders -- highly skilled foreign workers with temporary work visas," said Joseph Panetta, president of BIOCOM San Diego, the regional trade association for the biotech and biomedical industries.
In San Diego about 1,500 H-1B visa holders are employed and demand for these highly-skilled workers could increase 25 percent by 2001, Panetta said.
In recent years, H-1B has become a hotly debated issue in Congress.  In 1998 legislators tried to solve the labor shortage in the biotech and high-tech industries by increasing foreign visas to 115,000 individuals per year from 65,000 individuals.  But the number decreases to 107,500 for the 12 months ending in October and to 65,000 in 2001.
Seeking another fix, the biotech and high-tech industries are supporting S. 2045, a bill by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, which would increase the number of H-1Bs to 200,000 a year through 2003.
While the issue of H-1B highlights a crucial problem, stop-gap legislation won't address the deep, underlying cause -- a large proportion of San Diegans don't graduate from college; and of those who do, not enough are pursuing science and engineering careers.  These disturbing trends confine many to second-class status in our New Economy.
In 1995 the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the largest, most comprehensive, and most rigorous international study of schools and students ever conducted, showed that American students lagged behind their international counterparts at key grade levels.  In addition to unsettling results, TIMSS also revealed a promising finding.  When students are instructed by confident, well-trained teachers and participate in content-rich math and science curricula, they can outperform their high-achieving international rivals.
In San Diego we're beginning to see hopeful signs that educators, employers and elected officials are connecting math and science education with workplace readiness and regional competitiveness.  One hopeful sign is California's and the nation's first High Tech High School, which opened its doors on Sept. 18 to 200 ninth and 10th graders on the former Naval Training Cener in Point Loma. A tuition-free, publicly financed charter school open to all students, High Tech High provides project-based learning in math and science and real-world industry experience.
Another hopeful sign is the San Diego Workforce Partnership, which recognizes the critical shortage of skilled workers and is making efforts to curb it.  The partnership is coordinating a regional workforce-planning symposium called "San Diego's Workforce -- Our Competitive Edge," at the San Diego Convention Center today.  At this daylong, planning session, employers will discuss employee skill requirements and educators will try to translate those needs into curricula and training programs.
"The point of the conference is to begin to determine how best to develop a pipeline of trained workers who will meet businesses needs," said Lawrence Fitch, president and CEO of the Workforce Partnership.
There is no lack of creativity and excitement in our community.  You can see it in the launching of High Tech High, the formation of the San Diego Workforce Partnership, and the number and variety of professional certificate programs at UCSD and San Diego State University.
These efforts and future initiatives will help close the gap between skilled and unskilled workers in San Diego's biotech and high-tech industries.
Still, we must remember that high-skilled, high-salaried jobs are only part of what we seek.  The other part, the most important part, is creating exciting opportunities for talented, highly motivated teams of employees who -- despite what cynics say -- can and will change the world.

Growing issue; Farmers see a labor crunch, field hands don't, as chances of guest-worker legislation improve
The San Diego Union-Tribune

CALEXICO -- By 4:30 a.m. most mornings, as many as 10,000 people are huddled on the street corners and in the parking lots of this small downtown, hoping to be hired for work in the fields.
But when the employers' vans and buses pull away, scores of men and women are routinely left behind -- another day without work.
This scene at the gateway to the Imperial Valley, America's winter salad bowl, happened time and again in January.  Workers far exceeded jobs, just as they routinely do in fruit- and vegetable-growing regions throughout the United States.  It's an impression bolstered by high unemployment rates in farming regions, with Imperial County's among the highest at 23 percent.
Across the country in the nation's capital, however, a contradictory story is told.
Farm owners are complaining to Congress of a serious labor shortage.  The only solution, they say, is a new guest-worker program that would allow them to temporarily hire foreigners.
But if growers can't find enough people to harvest their fields, why are unemployment rates so high in agricultural communities?  Why is there a labor shortage amid a labor surplus?
Conflicting answers to these questions have been offered for decades, as guest-worker legislation has been introduced in Congress -- and voted down.
This year, however, guest-worker legislation is gaining new momentum.
When President Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox met this month, they formed a high-level team charged, among other things, with producing a guest-worker plan.
Both presidents believe that such a program would help stem illegal immigration and protect Mexican workers in the United States.
"The sense I've got is, this is the year if we can put the right plan together," said Bob Vice, a Fallbrook grower who as president of the National Council of Agricultural Employers leads the lobbying effort.  The organization represents three-quarters of the country's farm employers.
Imperial County contract harvester Steve Scaroni points to his own situation as an example of why a guest-worker program is needed.
Every day, his buses load up workers in a Calexico parking lot.  And even though thousands of people are there looking for work, he says that in the past two months his crews have been shorthanded by 5 to 50 percent.
Scaroni offered explanations for why there appear to be more workers than jobs most mornings.
"They probably don't want to work in the first place.  Or they're very selective about what jobs they'll do," he said.  "A lot come for the socializing, to see their friends."
Scaroni also notes that field jobs, which pay slightly more or less than California's minimum wage of $6.25 an hour, aren't as attractive as other entry-level jobs, like construction.
Picking fruit and vegetables is physically draining, and people quickly switch to better-paying, year-round positions.
But there's little hard evidence to back up the growers' claim of a labor shortage.
The California Employment Development Department "doesn't have anything that documents a labor shortage" in farm communities, said an agency spokeswoman.
In fact, some of the state's highest unemployment rates in December were in agricultural regions -- the 23 percent in Imperial County, 14 percent in Fresno and Madera counties, 12 percent in Monterey County, 11 percent in Kern County, 9 percent in San Joaquin County.
The national unemployment rate, meanwhile, was 4 percent.
After the harvest, the rates soar even higher in agricultural regions.  In July, Imperial County's rate was 34 percent.
The Employment Development Department's director, Michael Bernick, points out that many of the people collecting unemployment wouldn't be suited for field work.
But he also said that California's agricultural community tends to bypass the state employment system, turning instead to informal hiring networks like the morning gatherings in downtown Calexico.
Even Fallbrook grower Vice admits there's no proof of labor shortages.
"But it's been tight," he adds quickly, noting that employers are going to great lengths to fill their crews.  Some offer incentives, such as paying part of the wages up front, he said.  Others accept less-qualified applicants, including those who seem drunk.
Outside the Donut Avenue cafe in Calexico, a number of workers staked their own position in the debate.
Raul Rubio said he's never seen a labor shortage in the 22 years he's worked in Imperial Valley and Yuma fields, and he's not seeing one now.
"They're lying," he said, shaking a finger to make his point.  "The wages wouldn't be so low if there weren't enough workers."
o o o
The strongest argument for a new guest-worker program is its promise of changing the illicit system that has grown up over the past five decades.
Illegal immigrants make up more than half of the current U.S. crop work force of 1.8 million, creating an apartheid underclass that has woven itself into the U.S. agricultural industry.
Every year, 150,000 immigrants enter illegally, knowing that if they can make it across the border they can find work, often in the fields.  Each year, 300 to 400 people die of exposure, dehydration or abusive treatment during the journey.
Once in the United States, many are reluctant to return home because of high smugglers' fees and tight border security.  They live furtive existences, ever vigilant to detection.
Some 50,000 farm workers come to the United States legally each year through a small existing agricultural guest-worker program called H-2A.
But growers complain that H-2A requires cumbersome proof that workers are needed, then can't deliver them in time to do the work.  They'd prefer a program modeled after the H-1B guest-worker program that has allowed U.S. technology firms to import more than a half million high-tech workers since 1990.
The growers' arguments are compelling:
[] Foreign workers could come here safely, earn legal U.S. wages and be freed from a life of hiding and exploitation.
[] The influx of undocumented workers would slow, saving the U.S. government much of the $1 billion spent annually on border control.
[] Employers could stop pretending they don't hire illegals.  And a blow would be dealt to counterfeiters who sell false documents to field workers.
Such arguments have gained the growers unusual allies, including the United Farm Workers union.  Its president, Arturo Rodriguez, said the union and the growers have spent years coming to terms on the subject.
"I tend to disagree with the industry that there's a real need and a real shortage of workers," Rodriguez said.  "But we have been clear that the only way we'll accept a guest-worker program is if workers' wages are protected, that housing is protected, that some type of transportation is protected and also that if there is a problem they can have somewhere to go for help."
But guest-worker programs, wherever they have been implemented, often fall short of the lofty ideas that preceded them.
The previous U.S. experience with such an arrangement -- the controversial "bracero" program that lasted from the end of World War II to the mid-1960s -- was rife with abuse and fraud.
And when the bracero workers told friends and family about their U.S. earnings, Mexicans without documents also began coming to the United States, establishing an ongoing pattern of illegal migration.
"No program like this could ever be implemented without triggering a new massive wave of immigration," said Dan Stein, director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR.  "The growers want cheap labor, but society ends up with needy people."
Other countries also have found that guest workers become permanent residents.
Of the Turks recruited to work in Germany from the 1950s to 1970s, about half stayed on.
And 15 percent of the approximately 15,000 Mexicans recruited each year in a Canadian guest-worker program fail to return home.  Among those who participate five or more years, the number climbs to 50 percent.
Guest-worker programs can also restrict individual freedoms.
"The worker is dependent on the employer to get a visa for the next year," said Bruce Goldstein, co-director of the Farmworker Justice Fund.
"This puts them in a very vulnerable economic status (that) prevents many from asking for wage increases or challenging unfair employment practices.  It also denies workers the democratic freedoms this country was based on."
o o o
Two guest-worker measures are taking shape.
One is being prepared by agricultural employers, with the backing of the United Farm Workers and some immigration advocacy groups.
The other is being developed by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who wrote the H-1B high-tech measure, but helped kill last year's farm guest-worker bill.
Gramm and four other U.S. senators traveled to Mexico City last month to discuss their ideas with President Fox.
Both plans would authorize temporary use of foreigner workers in the United States.  They differ greatly, however, on recruitment, wages and housing, and on what Mexico's role should be.
Some of the growers want to tap workers from countries other than Mexico.
"I'd probably skip to El Salvador because they are great people and hard workers," said Scaroni, the Imperial Valley contractor.
The growers also would give guest workers the right to someday live permanently in the United States.  Under Gramm's plan, they could not.
The most controversial element of Gramm's plan offers guest-worker status first to undocumented immigrants already in the United States.  When the visas they would be granted expired, however, they'd have to go home and reapply to return.
"The intent would be to assure employers weren't turning away Americans," said Gramm's press secretary, Larry Neal.  "It will not be a revival of the old bracero program, nor will it be an amnesty program that invites people to come to stay."
Last year's bill, Neal said, "was something like serfdom and it ended with amnesty.  And Senator Gramm is opposed to both serfdom and amnesty."
To agricultural employers, the most important issue in any new legislation is who would determine when workers are needed -- who, in effect, can open the gate.
Under the growers' proposal, they would merely notify the government that they need field hands.  That way, they say, they could streamline the process and get workers in time for harvests so crops wouldn't rot in the fields.
The growers strongly oppose Gramm's suggestion that employers be required to exhaust local unemployment rolls before hiring guest workers.
Vice, who contends that few people on unemployment are qualified for field work, said, "Under that system, we'd have a hard time getting any workers at all."
o o o
Imperial County is rare among U.S. agricultural regions in that its growers already have access to a huge group of foreign workers who cross the border legally each day from Mexicali.
At the peak of the 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. commute, as many as 5,000 Mexicans walk through the pedestrian gates each hour.  They have U.S.-issued permits, which allow them to work days in the United States and go home to Mexico at night.
But even with this abundance of workers, Imperial Valley growers are leading the call for more foreign workers.
Agricultural experts are split on whether a guest-worker program would resolve this paradox.  They agree, however, that the likelihood of Congress passing a new guest-worker program has never been stronger.
"What we have that is different is a president in Mexico who recognizes the problem in Mexico and wants to fix it," said Gramm spokesman Neal.  "And fortunately we have a president in Washington who also recognizes the problem and wants to fix it."

Suzanne Hunt has an ambition.
She wants to work with patients who are undergoing clinical trials, which are experimental studies to treat or prevent disease. There is, however, a catch: the IDEC clinical research assistant, who graduated a couple of years ago from UC Irvine with a bachelor's degree in biology, didn't have the specific skills or on-the-job experience required to work with this special group of patients. Not to be deterred, Suzanne enrolled in a professional certificate program in Clinical Trials Design and Management at UCSD Extension.
There, she learned the clinical trials' process and obtained the knowledge and training she needs to move ahead in a rewarding career. This is one small example of how communication and cooperation between educators and employers can convert specialized training and development needs into enhanced job skills.
Still, it's just the start. Two ominous trends -- the growing demand for high-tech visas and the large proportion of non-college-bound high school graduates -- indicate we need to do a better job training and developing employees and educating students for high-skilled jobs in San Diego now and in the decade ahead.

South Asians searching cyber-world for spouses

From a distance, she seemed perfect.  Her e-mail messages were witty, evoking the chemistry Tariq Ahmed longed for in a soul mate.
But after an 11-hour drive to Toledo, Ohio, Ahmed's vision of the perfect bride vaporized the moment they met.
"There was no mutual attraction," says Ahmed, a 29-year-old Web engineer in Palo Alto.  "It was like going to the counter and ordering something."
Ahmed, a Canadian citizen who is half Pakistani and half Austrian, wound up driving from Ottawa to Ohio because he wanted to find a Muslim wife without enduring the awkward ritual of family-brokered introductions.
So the self-described "Net freak" took the route favored by growing numbers of South Asians these days: He posted a personal ad on a matrimonial Web site geared specifically toward his culture, in which arranged marriage is still common.
Unlike broader matchmaking sites that hook up singles on dates, South Asian matrimonial sites, as the phrase implies, are frankly aimed at finding partners for life, wherever they are.
Geography is less of an obstacle than the uniquely South Asian categories of religion and caste, common search fields on matrimonial sites.
Ahmed pursued love through Matrimonials.com, run by 4You Net Services Inc. of Lakewood, Ohio.
Its site offers one link for Indians -- "for people of South Asian heritage" -- and another for Muslims "of any origin," most of whom are from the subcontinent.
The site charges a $30 membership fee to post a six-month ad that enters a searchable database of thousands of marriage-minded men and women of Indian and South Asian descent.
Modern technology
It's just one of scores of such Internet venues that have sprung up in recent years to accommodate sophisticated South Asians around the world, blending ethnic tradition with modern technology.
The sites are a high-tech version of a decades-old Indian custom of newspaper matrimonial ads, and a natural extension of a culture of matchmaking, whether between families, friends or professional marriage brokers.
Some young South Asians are turned off by the sites.
"The Web sites I see have guys on them like the ones my parents want me to marry, a.k.a. nerds," says Monica Bhatnagar, 24, who grew up in Alameda.  "They may be perfectly great husbands, but I prefer to find someone on my own."
That was harder for Ahmed.  The son of a religious Pakistani father and an Austrian mother who converted to Islam, he couldn't date at all.
"Tradition won't let you meet a person 50 times," he says.  "You have only two or three times, and then you make a decision."
'Nothing to say'
Family introductions in Ottawa were excruciating ordeals during which Ahmed and his potential bride "were just sitting there with nothing to say because parents are talking about things that happened in 1946," the tumultuous year that led to the partition of India and Pakistan.
Ahmed had another strategy to meet women.
"Weddings are your best bet," he says.  "I made sure I was at every wedding, dressed to the max."
But Ahmed's fashion displays didn't get results, and it didn't take him long to reject the handful of eligible Muslim women introduced by relatives.
"You go through everybody's list of contacts real fast," he says.  "My parents, uncles and seven aunts could only come up with a handful of daughters.  I decided, OK, the only way this is going to happen is if I have a lot more control."
When Ahmed turned 24 in 1996, he decided to conduct his own search.
A Web ad seemed an efficient and more individualistic way to find a spouse than the hidebound methods of family setups, newspaper ads and paid matchmakers.
"My parents had no idea what was going on," he says.  "It was stealth."
Ahmed scanned other matrimonial ads and strove to outdo them with his computer engineering background.
The result was a graphically sophisticated ad featuring "husband model 49321." It included pictures of Ahmed's cat and statistics on his lung capacity -- 2 liters -- in order to stand out amid the crowded databases of eligible South Asian singles.
Ahmed's sassy ad subtly mocked the usual sought-after attributes such as skin color.  Fair skin, or "wheatish" as they say in India, is highly valued among South Asians, and some matrimonial Web sites include it as a search category.
The largest sites -- such as Matrimonials.com, IndianMarriages.com, SuitableMatch.com, Matrimonial- online.com and Cyberproposal.com -- all allow members to seek dream spouses with categories ranging from simple criteria such as height, caste and horoscope to ultra-detailed scans tailor-made for the South Asian diaspora.
If you're in the market for, say, a fair-skinned, vegetarian, Sikh engineer in the United States on an H-1B visa, IndianMarriages.com's site can look for his ad.
But matrimonial-site operators say the most requested search categories are weight, height, religion, caste and occupation.
Hundreds of responses
Ahmed got more than 400 e-mail responses from all over the world.  He wrote back to each and every one.
He began spending eight to 12 hours a day -- at work -- sending e-mail, whittling down the list and eventually driving to meet 17 women in places as far as Toledo and Milwaukee.
"I only have so much vacation time, and I have to drive," Ahmed says.  "I can't spend thousands of dollars on flights to meet someone when statistically the odds that they're the one are low."
His choices were far more numerous today than they would have been even a decade ago.
The number of expatriate South Asians has swelled, propelled in part by a technology boom that has lured software-proficient programmers and engineers to American and Canadian soil.
By 1997, there were 748,000 Indian-born U.S. residents, up 66 percent from 1990. As the ranks of South Asians have grown, matchmaking sites to serve them have evolved well beyond their early prototypes.
Now the sites are round-the-clock businesses, and some say they are profitable, though they won't disclose numbers.
Matrimonialonline.com, one of the largest sites, operates out of the Fremont apartment of Suresh Ganapathy, whose day job is as an information technology manager at a financial services firm in San Francisco.
Ganapathy maintains the 5-year-old site with the help of an office in India and his family.  His sister, Subbulakshmi, is a software engineer who backs up the database after she gets home from her day job in Cupertino.
Ganapathy's wife, Priya Suresh, works full time answering e-mail and modifying profiles of their 2,800 paid members.
The family spends weekends tending to the site, which generates an average of 300 e-mails a day.
The earliest paid members were mostly South Asian men living in the United States and Canada.  But now membership is more evenly split between the genders, with more and more men and women posting ads from India.  The same holds true for other sites.
Gautam Ghosh, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania, finds symbolism in the use of the Internet to find a South Asian spouse, given growing pride in India's role as a software superpower.
"People think the software industry is what will get India out of its Third World stigma," Ghosh says.  "The medium is the message here.  The very fact that you're using an online service suggests you're desirable."
The medium took a few years to pay off for Ahmed.
After two years of advertising himself on the Net, Ahmed was disappointed -- and exhausted.  His Toledo rendezvous was the first of many, and they went downhill from there.
"My e-mails were getting shorter and shorter," he says.  "Sometimes I'd just cut and paste my lifelong story."
In 1998, Ahmed moved to the Bay Area on a special work visa.  He took a break from his search, but kept exchanging e-mail with a woman in Singapore named Juliana Gidwani.
Like Ahmed, Gidwani is racially mixed -- half Indonesian, half Indian -- and had similar interests.
One day, Ahmed says, they were "talking ICQ" -- chatting in real time on the Net -- when something clicked.
Ahmed rolled the dice.  He'd seen Gidwani's picture and thought she was attractive, so he bought a ticket to Singapore, regarding it as a vacation if nothing panned out.
Cupid struck at the arrival gate.
"As soon as I saw her at the airport, I knew she was the one," Ahmed says.  He asked for her hand two days later.
Three months after that, in September 1999, they were married in an elaborate three-day celebration in Singapore, which he posted to the Web (http://www.dopejam.com/memories/mywed). 
They live in Tracy so Gidwani can commute to an MBA program at the University of California Davis.

Vote near to allow more high-tech worker visas

WASHINGTON -- The Senate is poised to pass a bill next week to increase the number of immigrant high-tech workers -- a step sought by San Diego's Qualcomm and technology companies in Silicon Valley -- following intense political maneuvering on Capitol Hill. But there's more politicking to come, both Democrats and Republicans predict. After months of delay, the so-called H-1B visa bill hit more snags this past week as Republican leaders blocked Democrats' attempts to attach amendments that would grant amnesty to some long-term illegal residents and to refugees from Central America and the Caribbean. While some Republicans termed the amnesty package simple pandering for votes, Latinos seeking the measures blasted the GOP for lacking the "compassionate conservatism" embraced by their presidential contender, Texas Gov. 
George W. Bush. Now, both the amnesty and the high-tech measures seem to be going their separate ways. Democrats vowed to attach the immigration reforms to appropriation bills. Democratic leaders also insisted they would sustain a threatened White House veto if the amnesty measures are not included. The maneuvering highlighted a congressional session that is winding down while a national election campaign is heating up. Both parties are trying to tap the growing influence of the Latino electorate, as well as the clout of the high-tech industry, a heavy contributor to political campaigns. The high-tech visa bill seems certain of passage.
The Senate anticipates considering the legislation -- without the amnesty amendments -- as early as Tuesday. Many technology companies like Qualcomm and others in San Diego that have long sought to increase the number of high-tech visas say hundreds of thousands of jobs are going unfilled nationwide because of the lack of qualified workers. Delays in obtaining more visas have resulted in "lost sales, stalled or shelved projects," said Sandra J. Boyd, chairwoman of the American Business for Legal Immigration, a coalition of high-tech businesses. Despite the high-tech industry's political clout, some labor groups contend that older American workers have been shortchanged by the high-tech visa program because it has lacked protections for U.S. employees.
Other problems include allegations of fraud and lack of oversight by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, according to congressional investigators. Under current law, the government issued 115,000 of the visas this year for skilled workers from abroad, most of whom are from India.
But that ceiling falls to 107,500 for the next fiscal year, which begins tomorrow, and to 65,000 in the fiscal year after that.
Industry officials say they already have exhausted the existing supply of visas, which expire after six years. The new measure would grant about 195,000 high-tech visas in each of the next three years. "Clearly," said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., "there is strong bipartisan support in the Senate for increasing the number of visas for high-skilled workers." The amnesty bill package has a far less certain future. Some key Senate Republicans echoed the sentiments of Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who criticized the Clinton administration for trying to "create a new class of citizens independent of what is present law." But Latino leaders said they have obtained some Republican support that makes them hopeful for the legislation's passage. One measure would grant amnesty for 500,000 immigrants who entered the United States illegally, but have lived in this country since before 1986. Another would offer permanent residence to political refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti similar to those granted to people who fled Cuba and Nicaragua. "These people deserve fair treatment," said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.
"These families are building lives and need a chance to be treated fairly under the law."

President's plan rewards immigrants for illegal entry

Louisa Luk arrived in San Diego by way of an F-1 student visa.
As a condition of being allowed in this country, the Hong Kong native had to not only prove she had the financial means to pay for her American education but also substantiate her "nonimmigrant" intent. In other words, she had to guarantee U.S. immigration officials that, upon completion of her studies, she would return to her home country.
If she wanted to stay here and work -- too bad. She has to go back home and hope she's fortunate enough to score one of the limited number of H-1B visas allotted each year by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Which is why Luk is offended that the Bush administration is considering a plan to bestow permanent legal status -- don't call it "amnesty," the White House implores -- upon many of the 3 million Mexicans living illegally in the United States. The idea is to first grant Mexican illegals temporary "guest worker" legal status.
Then the freshly minted Mexican guest workers could apply for permanent legal status. That's all well and good as far as Luk is concerned.
But she wonders why the Bush administration plan, developed by Secretary of State Colin Powell and Attorney General John Ashcroft, is not being equally magnanimous to other illegal immigrant populations. "I don't doubt that Mexicans are hardworking," she says.
"They do a lot of jobs that Americans don't want to do.
But so do the Chinese and other (immigrant) groups that are desperate to become legal in the `Land of Plenty'." Luk is right.
It is patently unfair to give illegal immigrants from Mexico preferential treatment over illegals hailing from other countries.
The 14th Amendment guarantees "equal protection of the laws."
Yet, the Bush administration proposes to give Mexican illegals more-than-equal protection. But even if the White House proposed to give all 8 million illegal immigrants in this country permanent legal status, it would still be wrongheaded immigration policy.
Because it would make a mockery of the principle, says Luk, that "everyone should have to come to the U.S. the legal way." Of course, to publicly state this view, particularly with respect to illegal Mexican immigrants, is to run the risk of being tarred as racist or xenophobic or both.
Of being an immigrant basher like former California Gov. Pete Wilson or former GOP presidential candidate Pat Buchanan. But the folks who tend to feel strongest about this are other immigrants, like Luk, who have followed the letter of U.S. immigration law; who have taken the time, trouble and expense to enter this country the right way. Indeed, Texas Sen. Phil Gramm noted last week that some 7 million Mexican immigrants have legally applied to enter the country and are waiting for INS to approve their paperwork. It seems an insult to these legal Mexican immigrants that 3 million of their less-scrupulous countrymen should be able to win permanent legal status without doing anything more than stealing across the border. If the Bush administration's proposal to "regularize" (remember, don't call it "amnesty") illegal Mexican immigrants would solve the illegal immigration problem once and for all -- or at least reduce the numbers of illegals besieging this country each year -- then it might be worth implementation. But it is hard to see how this 2001 plan to confer legal status on up to 3 million undocumented Mexicans will have any more positive effect on illegal immigration than the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which previously granted legal status to 3 million illegal immigrants. Indeed, the one indisputable outcome of legalizing illegal immigrants is to tacitly encourage even more illegal immigration.
For if federal lawmakers granted amnesty in 1986, if they approve "regularization" in 2001, there's no reason not to expect that another round of amnesty will come around, say, 2016. To oppose granting permanent legal status for Mexican illegal immigrants is not to oppose immigration altogether -- although amnesty advocates attempt to confuse the issues.
It is only to say that those who violate this nation's immigration laws should not be rewarded with amnesty. For the United States will never control its borders unless it sends a clear message to people around who desire to immigrate to this land of the free, home of the brave: Come one.
Come all.
But come legally. Perkins can be reached via e-mail at joseph.perkins@uniontrib.com.

Biotech is one of few industries still hiring
The San Diego Union-Tribune
October 21, 2001 Sunday

Though few industries can claim to be recession-proof, the biotechnology sector is shaping up to be more resistant to pink slips than most. The already teetering economy, hit hard by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, has pushed some struggling industries to the brink and beyond.
High-tech or low -- from the telecom to the travel industry -- many companies are laying off employees or imposing hiring freezes. Yet the local and national market for skilled biotech workers remains strong, and in select areas -- such as chemistry and bioinformatics -- there are more jobs than people to fill them, say industry experts. Biotech companies are posting job positions in newspapers and trade journals, mounting career fairs, and paying executive search firms to fill positions at a time when other industries are hunkering down. At BioSpace.com, a leading Web site for biotech industry news, job postings continue to flourish.
The San Francisco company hosts a popular online "career center" where U.S. biotech companies post an average of 2,500 job openings each month. In the past six months, through the growing economic malaise and terrorist attacks, those job postings have dropped off only 1 percent, said BioSpace spokeswoman Lisa Roth. "Biotech is one of the few industries still actively hiring," said Roth, whose Web site attracts 800,000 visitors and 4 million page views each month.
"Companies are still getting funded, research and development is strong." Cushioning the biotech industry from the larger downturn are factors that would make conservative investors shudder: most biotechs don't have a product or make a profit, and don't have a prayer of getting either for years. So financial realities that drive decisions in more traditional industries -- quarterly profits and losses -- aren't such a force with biotech.
In biotech, what matters is how much money is raised from private and public offerings, the rate at which it's spent, and how much longer it will take to get a product to market. And on those fronts, the biotechnology sector is relatively well positioned, industry observers agree.
Many biotechs are flush with cash from record financings and initial public offerings completed last year, and the number of drugs and medical products in late-stage development are at a peak. Still, there are warning signs that biotech may be headed for some financially humbling times, particularly among startups that rely on venture capital funding. Venture capital companies are investing less money in biotech firms this year, in part because their ability to cash out has dimmed with the public's aversion for initial public offerings. "There is smart money sitting out there looking for good business plans and management, and those companies will get money," said Tom Murphy, who heads the biotech unit of R.J. Watkins & Co., a San Diego executive recruitment company.
"But venture capital is more cautious and judicious in the deals that they do, and that will influence what young companies can do." Yet despite a slowdown in venture capital that will cramp many biotechs' plans, the sector is still capturing a larger percentage of overall venture capital investment, according to the National Venture Capital Association. The biotech industry raised $3 billion in venture capital last year, about 3 percent of the total $100 billion.
This year, the biotech industry is expected to raise about $2 billion, or 4 percent of the anticipated $50 billion in venture capital distributed. Meanwhile, biotech companies are expanding as corporate partnerships get forged and products are approved.
Locally, Isis Pharmaceuticals, which recently signed a $200 million deal with Eli Lilly, expects to hire as many as 100 new employees in the coming year. Both Invitrogen Corp. and Idec Pharmaceuticals are adding significantly to their work forces.
And several large pharmaceutical companies are expanding in the area, including Novartis, Pfizer and Elan Pharmaceuticals, which is hosting a hiring fair next month. "There's no indication that employment is down at all.
In fact, it's just the other way around," said Joseph Panetta, president of Biocom, the local biotech industry association that represents 216 San Diego County companies. In some crucial areas, the biotech industry may even face additional employee shortages in coming months.
Locally, about 6.5 percent of the biotech work force is imported -- foreign professionals with hard-to-find skills who enter the country on H-1B visas. With the recent terrorist attacks, the mood on Capital Hill has cooled toward some immigration programs.
According to a survey last week by Lawyers Weekly, H-1B and other visa applications that were routinely approved in the past may now face long delays or rejections. "We've had calls from some who say Biocom should be more cautious about supporting the H-1B visa program in the wake of the terrorist situation -- that we should support more of a home-grown constituency," concedes Panetta.
"It doesn't sound good anymore to talk about it (the H-1B program)." Penni Crabtree's e-mail address is penni.crabtree@uniontrib.com. Her phone number is (619) 293-1237.

Biotech is one of few industries still hiring

Though few industries can claim to be recession-proof, the biotechnology sector is shaping up to be more resistant to pink slips than most.
The already teetering economy, hit hard by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, has pushed some struggling industries to the brink and beyond.  High-tech or low -- from the telecom to the travel industry -- many companies are laying off employees or imposing hiring freezes.
Yet the local and national market for skilled biotech workers remains strong, and in select areas -- such as chemistry and bioinformatics -- there are more jobs than people to fill them, say industry experts.
Biotech companies are posting job positions in newspapers and trade journals, mounting career fairs, and paying executive search firms to fill positions at a time when other industries are hunkering down.
At BioSpace.com, a leading Web site for biotech industry news, job postings continue to flourish.  The San Francisco company hosts a popular online "career center" where U.S. biotech companies post an average of 2,500 job openings each month.
In the past six months, through the growing economic malaise and terrorist attacks, those job postings have dropped off only 1 percent, said BioSpace spokeswoman Lisa Roth.
"Biotech is one of the few industries still actively hiring," said Roth, whose Web site attracts 800,000 visitors and 4 million page views each month.  "Companies are still getting funded, research and development is strong."
Cushioning the biotech industry from the larger downturn are factors that would make conservative investors shudder: most biotechs don't have a product or make a profit, and don't have a prayer of getting either for years.
So financial realities that drive decisions in more traditional industries -- quarterly profits and losses -- aren't such a force with biotech.  In biotech, what matters is how much money is raised from private and public offerings, the rate at which it's spent, and how much longer it will take to get a product to market.
And on those fronts, the biotechnology sector is relatively well positioned, industry observers agree.  Many biotechs are flush with cash from record financings and initial public offerings completed last year, and the number of drugs and medical products in late-stage development are at a peak.
Still, there are warning signs that biotech may be headed for some financially humbling times, particularly among startups that rely on venture capital funding.
Venture capital companies are investing less money in biotech firms this year, in part because their ability to cash out has dimmed with the public's aversion for initial public offerings.
"There is smart money sitting out there looking for good business plans and management, and those companies will get money," said Tom Murphy, who heads the biotech unit of R.J. Watkins & Co., a San Diego executive recruitment company.  "But venture capital is more cautious and judicious in the deals that they do, and that will influence what young companies can do."
Yet despite a slowdown in venture capital that will cramp many biotechs' plans, the sector is still capturing a larger percentage of overall venture capital investment, according to the National Venture Capital Association.
The biotech industry raised $3 billion in venture capital last year, about 3 percent of the total $100 billion.  This year, the biotech industry is expected to raise about $2 billion, or 4 percent of the anticipated $50 billion in venture capital distributed.
Meanwhile, biotech companies are expanding as corporate partnerships get forged and products are approved.  Locally, Isis Pharmaceuticals, which recently signed a $200 million deal with Eli Lilly, expects to hire as many as 100 new employees in the coming year.
Both Invitrogen Corp. and Idec Pharmaceuticals are adding significantly to their work forces.  And several large pharmaceutical companies are expanding in the area, including Novartis, Pfizer and Elan Pharmaceuticals, which is hosting a hiring fair next month.
"There's no indication that employment is down at all.  In fact, it's just the other way around," said Joseph Panetta, president of Biocom, the local biotech industry association that represents 216 San Diego County companies.
In some crucial areas, the biotech industry may even face additional employee shortages in coming months.  Locally, about 6.5 percent of the biotech work force is imported -- foreign professionals with hard-to-find skills who enter the country on H-1B visas.
With the recent terrorist attacks, the mood on Capital Hill has cooled toward some immigration programs.  According to a survey last week by Lawyers Weekly, H-1B and other visa applications that were routinely approved in the past may now face long delays or rejections.
"We've had calls from some who say Biocom should be more cautious about supporting the H-1B visa program in the wake of the terrorist situation -- that we should support more of a home-grown constituency," concedes Panetta.  "It doesn't sound good anymore to talk about it (the H-1B program)."

Foreign tech workers look north
Highly skilled visa holders discover, embrace easier immigration path in Canada

Ask Puneet Anand, 35, how he's adjusting to a new life in Toronto, and he doesn't miss a beat.
"I'm still getting used to the cold," he said. Rapidly dropping temperatures in southern Ontario are a change for Anand, who called San Diego home not too long ago.
"I miss the weather there," he said. "You just can't beat it."
Moving away wasn't always the plan. A former hardware engineer at Qualcomm, Anand was employed in the United States on an H-1B visa - a temporary status given to highly skilled foreign guest workers. A majority of workers are hired as engineers or computer scientists, with large populations in California. 
"It was a great company, and they filed for my green card early," he said. "But then in a few years, reality struck."
Like other Indian nationals, he was caught in a backlog for permanent residency in the United States. Employment-based green cards are capped at a certain number for every country, resulting in longer lines for nationalities with bigger pools of applicants, like India and China.
"I couldn't do anything but wait," said Anand. The uncertainty of permanent status made it harder to plan a future in America, he added. He began looking for solutions, eventually finding one that lay north of the border.
In 2019, Anand migrated to Canada through a program called the Global Skills Strategy (GSS). Implemented by the Canadian government in 2017, it allows expedited processing for a work visa, usually around two weeks. 
Faster immigration options for highly skilled workers have been growing. The Express Entry system was created in 2015 to manage permanent resident applications for skilled workers, awarding the status to qualified applicants.
Four years ago, around 10,000 foreign nationals received permanent residency through the program. In 2018, that number was nine times higher.
Though no data tracks highly skilled foreign workers moving from the United States to Canada, Indians and Chinese nationals working in tech accounted for the highest number of express entry admissions in 2018.
Immigration experts at the Toronto branch of law firm Fragomen have seen a large number of Indian nationals applying for permanent residency in Canada, a path that eventually leads to citizenship in three years.
Fast processing for immigration status is an advantage to both employees unsure of their status in the United States and employers, who could retain skilled workers in their foreign branches, said David Crawford, a partner at Fragomen's Toronto office.
"There's much greater certainty on the outcome," said Crawford. "It helps your whole decision making."
Apart from the backlog, other issues make the H1-B a more uncertain prospect than previous years. Denial rates have been steadily climbing, rising from 6 percent in 2015 to 24 percent in 2019, according to data reported by Mother Jones. Delays in processing visas prompted concern from more than 20 U.S. senators, who addressed the issues in a letter to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  in May.
Shalaka Maind, 29, was a biomedical engineer in Carlsbad, working on a student visa valid for only three years.
"My company applied for my visa twice, but I didn't get picked in the lottery," said Maind, referring to a computer generated random selection process that awards work visas every year.
Her husband also faced some obstacles finding his own work visa. Eventually, they decided to apply through the express entry system and migrate to Canada.
Saying goodbye to San Diego didn't come easily, but Maind said they've found a sense of stability in Toronto.
"It's a growing country," she said. "With the tech sector coming up, there are a lot of opportunities. Looking at our short-term and long-term options, we decided to pick coming here."
A small, still growing community of former H-1B tech workers has begun to burgeon in Toronto and Vancouver, cities that host a lineup of companies that rival Silicon Valley. While Google, Netflix and Microsoft have a large presence, startups have also begun to break ground.
Vikram Rangnekar, 36, founded one of them. The lure of starting his own venture drew him to leave behind a life in Silicon Valley.
"On an H-1B, you're tied to the employer you work for," he said, adding that a specific visa for entrepreneurs didn't exist. "And I'd always pursued startups. I had some friends who had begun startups in Toronto and I reached out to them."
Rangnekar decided to leave for Canada more than two years ago, using his LinkedIn account to document the experience.
"I just started blogging on LinkedIn and that exploded," he said. "A lot of people were interested in how I'd done it."
Answering that curiosity resulted in his next startup, a digital platform called MovNorth. A community forum and also a space for employers to seek out talent, the site is geared toward acquainting tech workers with the process of moving to Canada. Hundreds of threads receive replies every day, discussing the initial process of moving to Canada and settling in.
Many are former H1-B workers looking to build a home up north. Newcomers ask for housing and dining recommendations, whether  local schools are  good and inquire whether  anyone in the area would like to meet up.
"People tell me they moved here and found friends on the website," said Rangnekar.
Anand still speaks wistfully of San Diego's beaches and hikes to Potato Chip Rock. His new home, however, has been as welcoming.
"There's a very diverse community," he said of Canada's new wave of Indian immigrants. "In Qualcomm, most of the people we knew were engineers, but when people come through express entry, they're in various fields. I've learned a lot from people here."
Despite some restrictions, the H-1B is still the most sought-out visa in the United States. Over 150,000 petitions are filed every year, predominantly by tech giants who want to ensure that Silicon Valley is kept at the forefront of the tech sector.
But a quieter trend continues to build on forums like Rangnekar's, growing as Canada pushes itself to expand immigration and talent in its labor markets.
Though clients who've left the U.S. do express a desire to return, Fragomen attorney Audrea Golding said there is concern among U.S. companies that retaining them on work visas may become more difficult. Foreign branches of their offices may be a viable option, she added.
"Companies are doing more to keep the overseas options as a part of their long-term retention planning," said Golding. "And if you're in Canada, it's minimizing the disruption."

Sane immigration policy is first step
Re: "Unruly guests" and "Border security" (Editorials, Oct. 16):
Your editorials indicate that 40,000 cars and up to 130,000 individuals cross the San Diego border daily.  You then state that illegal immigration could be controlled if only more money was spent, and imply that terrorism would be stopped as a result.
Yet of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers, three overstayed their visas and no records were found concerning six others, implying that the remainder were here legally.  Even 19 is a very small percentage of the millions of foreign visitors.  The odds of the Immigration and Naturalization Service finding the right ones are infinitesimal, no matter how much money is spent.
The U.S. population is not homogeneous, and foreigners do not stand out as they would in China.  It might be possible to spot them if we implemented a national ID card (a good idea), but even that probably wouldn't work as papers can be forged and a minimum wage motel clerk couldn't tell a good ID from a bad one.
As one terrorist pointed out in a recent interview, the good guys need to be very good and very lucky all the time.  The terrorists need be lucky only once.  Spending more money to control illegal immigration is not the way to go. JOHN E. GAHAN Mira Mesa
While increased surveillance at our borders is a welcome change with many long-term benefits, it's clear that, in the short term, there are neither enough border officers nor appropriate scanning equipment to accommodate the number of people crossing the border.
The result has been onerous waits in lines for thousands of innocent people who want to cross the border for shopping or to work.  Businesses and families on both sides of the border are suffering economic hardships as a result.
While we are in this state of limited border resources, why not take a cue from the Europeans, and have separate lines for those border-crossers who are not citizens of a NAFTA country?  Non-NAFTA citizens could then be subjected to further, more detailed scrutiny.  That would focus our limited border resources on those individuals most likely to do us harm, while allowing the citizens of Mexico, Canada and the United States to move more freely across our borders for work and business. LESLIE ANDERSON Encinitas
If Mexicans are having trouble crossing the border to get to their jobs on time, perhaps these jobs could be filled by unemployed Americans. CRANE JOHNSON Jacumba
A country with millions of illegal immigrants and run-away legal immigration is either in the hands of a bunch of gutless politicos or the victim of a terrible border policy.  It's high time to rectify both. JIM HARRIS Coronado
No one in our government ever takes responsibility for mistakes, even if it costs 6,000 lives.
Energy Secretary and former Sen. Spencer Abraham is the man most responsible for gutting the 1996 immigration law designed to make it harder for terrorists to enter this country.  Abraham thought it was "bad for business" when INS tried to set up a visa entry/exit tracking system at our borders.  He delayed and finally watered down this measure.
He also was the point man for multinational corporations that wanted to increase H-1B visas, though it was later proven that there never was a high-tech worker shortage.  These workers never were given background checks and most never returned to their countries after their visas expired. LARRY BROWN Riverside
A badge can lead to abuse of power
Not everyone can handle being given the authority of a badge and uniform.  Many are prone to make up their own rules, and are likely to be overbearing.  This is a problem that must be guarded against, especially as our security efforts are being expanded so quickly.
Robert Peterson appears to have experienced an example of this abuse of authority by having his pocket knife confiscated by border security.
Though we must expect to be inconvenienced in some ways under the new circumstances, it must be controlled by laws, not the whims of individuals who are supposed to be protecting our rights. BOB BOUCHELL Chula Vista
Congress never agreed to put their lives at risk
Re: "One piece of mail and the House shuts down" (Letters, Oct. 23):
I was incensed by John-David Hughes' accusation that our Congress was derelict last week.  The House members made a wise decision to vacate their offices under the threat of anthrax.  I am certain they were following orders.
So the Senate decided to continue meeting.  Does that make it better?
The police and firefighters who did not retreat from the World Trade Center knew that risking their lives to save others goes with the territory.  Our representatives never agreed to risk their lives to do their jobs. ROXANNE LORENZ Santee
I'm sorry that people feel that keeping tens of thousands of government workers out of contaminated buildings is somehow dereliction of duty.  These people didn't sign up for the armed services.
Since when did we as a nation feel that our elected officials should be exposed to something as life-threatening as anthrax?  Don't we all wish we could have warned the occupants of the World Trade Center not to go into work on Sept. 11? The police and firefighters didn't run into the buildings to die.  They were hoping to save lives.
Dereliction of duty comes by purposely putting people in harm's way. ANN CIMA Escondido

U.S. turning away skilled workers it needs

Since 1990, the H-1B visa program has let companies temporarily employ foreign workers in occupations requiring specialized skills and a bachelor's degree - when they struggle to find a U.S. worker to do the job. The sensible program has faced intermittentcontroversies over the years because some companies used the visas to replace higher-paid Americans with lower-paid foreign workers. Some economists argue that H-1B visa holders help suppress wages in fields like computer science.
But with 700,000 tech jobs unfilled in the U.S., the value of and need for the program is difficult to dispute. This is why more than 60 U.S. business school deans and CEOs wrote a joint letter to the Wall Street Journal last month imploring President Donald Trump to expand the program and allow more than 85,000 H-1B visas to be issued a year.
Perhaps he'll listen. Perhaps not. The Trump administration not only doesn't grasp the value of H-1B visas, it is averse to them. A new study by the National Foundation for American Policy, based on government data, shows denial rates for H-1B visa requests have skyrocketed from 6% in 2015 to 24%. The White House also is seeking to make it more difficult for the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the U.S. No wonder that many foreigners working in the San Diego area are looking to relocate to Canada, a nation more welcoming of skilled immigrants.
Given that hostility to foreigners is the root of Trump's success as a politician, this is no surprise. Yet it is bad news for the U.S. economy - and for the future of a nation with an aging work force and a declining birthrate. The U.S. could use highly talented immigrants. The president should know this.

It's difficult for outsiders to borrow for a home

One of the coolest things about moving to the United States is that you don't have to be a citizen or even a permanent resident to borrow money to buy a home.
It isn't always easy for immigrants and long-term visitors to borrow money to buy houses.  They have to develop a solid credit history, learn about taxes and insurance, buy within their means and sometimes agree to less-than-ideal borrowing terms.  Native-born home buyers encounter some of the same obstacles, but the problems sometimes are magnified for the foreign-born.
The hurdles are especially high for the hundreds of thousands of people who are in the United States on temporary work visas.  The most common of these visas, the H-1B, lasts a maximum of six years for most holders.
A typical H-1B visa holder is a college graduate with specialized job skills (such as computer programming) or is a fashion model "of distinguished merit and ability," according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Although they may come to this country intending to gain permanent residency, people holding these long-term but temporary work visas are classified as "non-immigrants." The INS can order them back to their countries of origin when the visas expire.  That doesn't stop mortgage companies from lending money to them.
Rege Anu, a computer professional from India, came to the United States seven years ago and first considered buying a house in Somerset, N.J., two years ago, while he was still here on an H-1B visa.
"I was very close to buying a home," he says.  "I was pre-approved and ready to give an offer."
Anu's lender was more than willing to give him money, even though his visa would expire shortly and he could have been sent back to India if his application for permanent residency had been denied.  Two things stopped Anu from buying the house: job insecurity and naivete about home values (they were rising rapidly and he thought prices would go back down).
"Buying a house is a big commitment, and that's why I decided to stay until I got my green card," he says.  In November 2000 Anu got his green card denoting his status as a permanent resident.  In April he bought a home in the same neighborhood he had looked at two years before.
Anu got his loan from Arun Shah, a mortgage banker with The Provident Bank of Jersey City, N.J. Shah, who grew up in Bombay, specializes in mortgages for immigrants.
Shah says people who move to the United States sometimes have misconceptions.  They believe that the entire monthly mortgage payment is deductible from federal income taxes (the interest and property taxes are deductible). They often underestimate the costs of taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance, because many of those costs have been included in their rent.
Malcolm Campbell agrees that the most important thing is to buy within one's means.  Campbell, a native of Scotland who is here on a work visa and is an assistant manager at a Washington Mutual branch in Roswell, Ga., says new arrivals typically have to put at least 20 percent down and get an adjustable-rate mortgage.  Five- and seven-year hybrid ARMs are popular.
He says new arrivals should get Social Security cards immediately so they can establish a credit history.  It's crucial to obtain credit cards or auto loans and repay them on time.  "A lot come to America and don't understand the significance of paying bills on time," Campbell says.

Americans can fill those high-tech jobs
Re "H-1B visas a boon to aging U.S. work force. Someone tell Trump." (Nov. 19): You've got it all wrong.
Yes, it is vital that we attract needed talent from around the world, and then keep it here. But the H-1B program is a travesty. The companies applying for them (usually through a broker) constantly lie and misrepresent the situation. They want low-cost contractors and do their best to take advantage of these young foreigners.
Before I retired, I spent more than 40 years in the information technology business and I observed it all firsthand. There is, and always has been, an excellent source of talented Americans who can fulfill these roles: people over 40, who are often heavily discriminated against in this industry. Older Americans who are trained, experienced, available and willing to work on new, innovative and exciting projects.
Let's get honest about this, let the facts come out, and then devise a fair system that will solve the few real problems that exist (not the phony, made up problems). Start by canceling the corrupt H-1B program.

get with the times
Re "S.D. to spend $21 million on 4 police helicopters" (Nov. 20): My family and I are grateful for the service of those who risk their lives in furtherance of public safety. In other words, thank you officers. Yet, at times, the helicoptered police presence in Pacific Beach reminds me of "Boyz n the Hood." 
No one is a fan of crime, but maybe a fleet of drones would be more efficient and less obtrusive, or maybe not.

Re "Parents wait for answers, grieve for daughter" (Nov. 17): It is unsurprising that Apple's new credit card's algorithms automatically assign higher credit limits to men than to women, as reported on Nov. 9, if reporters can characterize a married 24-year-old as "the girl" in this front-page story. Especially since the phrase "19-year-old man" has appeared in several recent newspaper articles. 
Even if the dismissive term "girl" was used by the coroner's investigator, it is unfortunate that reporters did not think twice about reinforcing that dismissiveness when they summarized the investigator's comments. Let's at least give this deceased woman the dignity of being referred to as an adult.

North River Farms gives us hope for future 
Re "Oceanside council approves 585-home project" (Nov. 8): What I witnessed from the opposition to this project was classless. That type of behavior has gone on too long from the same people. It is not only degrading but insulting to treat anyone who does not share your beliefs or status like they don't belong.
I have lived on Oceanside 18 years. Many supporters of North River Farms were born and raised in Oceanside. We should be proud they showed up to support something they care about. This project appeals to me, my family and our future. It provides funding to Oceanside Unified, public farms, attainable homes and a fire station. The City Council voted for the future.

The left is much more likely to stifle opinions
Re "It's good to know what Trump fans think" (Nov 12): The letter headline included the word "fans," but actually the writer only knows what "a" fan thinks. 
I don't agree with anyone who tries to keep others from expressing themselves and their views. We all know it is our right. Who does that? Oh, yeah, many on the left, shutting people down left and right. If by some chance we have a Democratic president, you'll be lucky if you will be allowed to have a single thought of your own, especially if it doesn't agree with what Democrats deem acceptable. If they get their way, we shouldn't hear a single word of complaint from anyone who voted to put a Democrat in office.
With all of this "woke" and politically correct ridiculousness, everyone being offended by every little thing, I don't recognize my country anymore. Thank God for President Trump.

Americans must pay attention to hearings
Every American should familiarize themselves with what is going on in the impeachment hearings. Because of the credibility of these witnesses, it is no longer a question of whether the president did it, but rather whether it's OK that the president did it. 
If you are a Trump supporter, and think it's OK because he's "your guy," think about whether it would be OK if he was "their guy." The hypocrisy of Republican lawmakers is obvious, as they would be screaming to the high heavens if a Democrat had done this. If this president is allowed to use his office to extort political favors, obstruct justice, etc., then any president is allowed to do it.

Why would a woman lead any differently?
Re "Our nation could use a new kind of leader" (Nov. 18): The letter writer complains that previous presidents were far from perfect, then lists their defects such as semi-public nudity as well as various presidents' illicit affairs. She states that it is time for a different type of president, a woman. 
Is she really trying to say that all women are faithful in their marriages and that all women don't like nudity? All we need is voters who do research on the candidates they are planning to vote for. Usually individuals' past indiscretions go a long way in telling us who they are and what to expect from them.

It's difficult for outsiders to borrow for a home

One of the coolest things about moving to the United States is that you don't have to be a citizen or even a permanent resident to borrow money to buy a home. It isn't always easy for immigrants and long-term visitors to borrow money to buy houses.
They have to develop a solid credit history, learn about taxes and insurance, buy within their means and sometimes agree to less-than-ideal borrowing terms.
Native-born home buyers encounter some of the same obstacles, but the problems sometimes are magnified for the foreign-born. The hurdles are especially high for the hundreds of thousands of people who are in the United States on temporary work visas.
The most common of these visas, the H-1B, lasts a maximum of six years for most holders. A typical H-1B visa holder is a college graduate with specialized job skills (such as computer programming) or is a fashion model "of distinguished merit and ability," according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Although they may come to this country intending to gain permanent residency, people holding these long-term but temporary work visas are classified as "non-immigrants."
The INS can order them back to their countries of origin when the visas expire.
That doesn't stop mortgage companies from lending money to them. Rege Anu, a computer professional from India, came to the United States seven years ago and first considered buying a house in Somerset, N.J., two years ago, while he was still here on an H-1B visa. "I was very close to buying a home," he says.
"I was pre-approved and ready to give an offer." Anu's lender was more than willing to give him money, even though his visa would expire shortly and he could have been sent back to India if his application for permanent residency had been denied.
Two things stopped Anu from buying the house: job insecurity and naivete about home values (they were rising rapidly and he thought prices would go back down). "Buying a house is a big commitment, and that's why I decided to stay until I got my green card," he says.
In November 2000 Anu got his green card denoting his status as a permanent resident.
In April he bought a home in the same neighborhood he had looked at two years before. Anu got his loan from Arun Shah, a mortgage banker with The Provident Bank of Jersey City, N.J. Shah, who grew up in Bombay, specializes in mortgages for immigrants. Shah says people who move to the United States sometimes have misconceptions.
They believe that the entire monthly mortgage payment is deductible from federal income taxes (the interest and property taxes are deductible). They often underestimate the costs of taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance, because many of those costs have been included in their rent. Malcolm Campbell agrees that the most important thing is to buy within one's means.
Campbell, a native of Scotland who is here on a work visa and is an assistant manager at a Washington Mutual branch in Roswell, Ga., says new arrivals typically have to put at least 20 percent down and get an adjustable-rate mortgage.
Five- and seven-year hybrid ARMs are popular. He says new arrivals should get Social Security cards immediately so they can establish a credit history.
It's crucial to obtain credit cards or auto loans and repay them on time.
"A lot come to America and don't understand the significance of paying bills on time," Campbell says.

A MUCH-NEEDED REVERSAL; International students make the U.S. much stronger

Elon Musk, who immigrated to the United States, was once the holder of an H-1B visa. Imagine a world where due to United States' exclusionary immigration policies, Musk was forced to go to our economic competitor: China. It may be difficult to think of China being the beneficiary of the global headquarters of Tesla and SpaceX. However, this is the path the Trump administration has carved out for our country.
Recent actions by the White House limiting H-1B visas and the latest move from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement - forcing international students to leave the country unless enrolled in in-person classes - harm the innovation economy and place severe limits on a post-pandemic economic recovery for San Diegans and all Americans. Although the administration on Tuesday rescinded the decision to have foreign students leave the country, it is still symbolic of how it views foreign talent.
President Donald Trump is betting on his supporters believing in the long-held myth that foreign-born talent displaces domestic talent. Nothing can be further from the truth. For example, a 2017 study showed that U.S.-born workers gained $431 million as a result of the H-1B visa system in 2010.
In fact, a 2019 study found an astounding 45% of Fortune 500 companies were founded or co-founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants. You may recognize some of the names: Google, Intel, Apple and the aforementioned Tesla.
The increasingly hostile immigration policies from the White House are putting the growth of the innovation economy at severe risk. A study by UC San Diego's Gaurav Khanna drew a direct correlation between H-1B visa holders and accelerated innovation in U.S. companies via newer and better product development. It is especially important during the novel coronavirus pandemic that the innovation industry be allowed to access global talent, which is critical to the research and development sector's ability to develop drug therapies for COVID-19 treatments and in the global race for a vaccine.
The regional innovation economy in the past few years has realized the importance of foreign students to the San Diego economy. They have chartered Tech San Diego, deploying dedicated resources to help companies source talent from regional universities. Whether through internships, which often lead to full-time employment, or scouting graduating students for the best and the brightest, access to university talent is an important economic development differentiation for the region. If the administration ultimately gets its way in limiting foreign talent, this differentiator is at risk of being decapitated.
Although the administration has rescinded the immediate decision to send students home, we need to be prepared to protest any similar schemes to limit foreign students. UC San Diego has 9,000 foreign students and 2,000 recent graduates. These students and alumni enrich the region in countless ways beyond economic benefits. When they are there, they are able to see firsthand why San Diego is the technologies' perfect climate.
The students make lifelong connections to our region. And while some will stay in the community, the ones that return to their countries yield often surprising benefits in linking their region with San Diego.
They return to their homeland with an affinity for their time in the U.S and act as unpaid ambassadors of good will. Nationally, over 1 million students attend U.S. colleges and universities annually and, by one study, they yielded an estimated economic impact of $41 billion and created support for more than 450,000 U.S. jobs during the 2018-19 school year.
There is also a question of fairness; for many of these students, it is a lifelong dream to attend a top U.S. university like UC San Diego or San Diego State University. To simply state that they cannot attend college remotely during this global health crisis is neither fair nor safe.
So what do we do? First, we should be increasing the number of H-1B visa holders while at the same time making sure access to H-1B visas are fair and that no company is exploiting foreign workers. The process of securing an H-1B visa should be simplified and more accessible to small and midsize innovation companies.
The administration has been talking about merit-based immigration. While increasing H-1B visas is a good first step, we need to welcome foreign students from abroad and instead embrace their talent as an innovation and economic driver. All non-native graduates from accredited universities should be fast-tracked to a worker visa and incentivized to remain in the U.S.
Rather than having an adversarial position on immigration, immigration could be an economic partner in assisting new talent to remain in the United States. We need to finally end the drumbeat that foreign talent replaces domestic talent, as a chorus of studies have shown the positive economic and cultural benefits foreign talent brings to our nation.
Let's embrace our future foreign talent. Your own job may depend on it.
Carroll is the executive director of Tech San Diego, an association trade group representing the regional innovation economy. Website: techsandiego.org. He lives in San Diego.

E=MC what? Americans still don't know much about science

Can a nation debate the merits of cloning when fewer than half its adults can give a decent definition of DNA?
Can it render good judgment on genetically engineered food when only a quarter can define a molecule?
And can Americans assess competing medical claims when only a third show a good understanding of the scientific process?
Experts see cause for concern in the latest report card on American scientific understanding.  But they aren't surprised.
Like many people, Shirley M. Malcom, head of education for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, groans at "Tonight" show host Jay Leno's quiz of people on the street:
Leno: "Where would you find chlorophyll?"
Dante from Michigan: "Probably in your toilet."
(Correct answer: In plants.)
Leno broke the news about the new study to his audience:
"Here's something shocking.  According to a study by the National Science Foundation, 70 percent of Americans do not understand science.  Here's the sad part: 30 percent don't even know what 70 percent means."
That second statistic is only a joke.  But the foundation did report that a survey of American adults turned up these low numbers:
o 45 percent could define DNA, the substance carrying the inherited genetic code.
o 22 percent could define "molecule," the basic unit of a chemical compound.
o 45 percent knew lasers don't work by focusing sound waves.  Lasers use light waves.
o 48 percent knew electrons are smaller than atoms.
o 48 percent knew it's not true that the earliest humans lived at the same time as dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs and humans missed each other by some 60 million years.  But "we're interviewing people on the phone who grew up watching "Flintstones,'" said Melissa Pollak, senior analyst at the foundation.
Americans did better on some other questions.  Ninety-four percent knew cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, for example, and about three-quarters knew that some radioactivity is naturally produced, that continents are moving and that light travels faster than sound.
The survey's margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent.
In its current form, the survey has been given every two years since 1979 and overall the results haven't changed much, Pollak said.  "It's discouraging," she said.  "We'd hope people would know more than they seem to know about some basic science facts and concepts."
If it's any consolation, the United States did slightly better than 14 other industrialized countries in the early 1990s, ranking about equal to Denmark and the Netherlands, Pollak said.  Her quick look at new survey data suggests this country is still somewhat ahead, she said.
Leno's joke about percentages was based on the finding that only about one-third of survey participants showed a good understanding of the scientific process, including ideas about probability and how to do an experiment.
Possibly better
But some see reason for hope in survey results over the years.  Jon Miller of Northwestern University, who directed the survey from 1979 to '99, has his own index of scientific literacy.  It includes an understanding of scientific process plus vocabulary.
By that gauge, "the trend in the last decade has been very encouraging," he said, with science literacy growing from 10 percent in 1988 to 17 percent in 1999. He hasn't calculated the number for the new survey.
Miller, director of the Center for Biomedical Communication at Northwestern's medical school, found in 1997 that Americans scored higher on science literacy than Europeans, Japanese or Canadians.  That's probably unchanged, he said.
Which brings up another question from Leno:
Leno: "What keeps the Earth orbiting around the sun?"
Sarah from Cleveland: "The gravitational pull of the moon."
(Correct answer: The gravitational pull of the sun.)
What bothers Pollak the most is the finding that only about a third of adults showed a good understanding of the scientific process.
"This is where science can benefit people in their daily lives," Pollak said.  People get bombarded with claims by psychics and medical quacks, she said, and if they don't understand about critical thinking and scientific evidence, they can waste time and money.
That understanding also helps citizens confront scientific political issues where the media are often content to present both sides of an argument, no matter which side has better evidence, said Malcom of the AAAS.
"How is one to discern the difference between an argument which is fairly weak, and one which is fairly strong?" she said.  "Who is pulling your leg and who is telling you the straight poop, and on what basis?"
Moreover, experts say, as technology spreads through the nation's jobs, workers will have to be able to use it and the critical-thinking and problem-solving skills that should be learned in science classes.
There's another, related concern.  How will the United States provide a sufficient supply of qualified workers for careers in science and technology?  Nowadays, the nation is leaning heavily on foreign help.
At Human Genome Sciences of Rockville, Md., only about half the workers with the highest levels of technical skill were born in the United States, estimates chief executive officer William Haseltine.
More broadly, foreign workers are "indispensable," Haseltine says.
"We could not function in our government laboratories, in our academic laboratories and in our industrial laboratories without these workers," Haseltine says.  "I would guess we would drop in productivity by about 50 percent or more.  We simply don't train enough (American) people."
In fact, about 10 percent of the American work force in biotechnology -- including drug companies -- are foreign nationals who hold an "H-1B" visa that lets them work here temporarily, said Steve Dahms, who chairs the work-force committee of the U.S. Council of Biotechnology Centers.
Their importance goes beyond the 10 percent figure, he said.
"In terms of the overall process of drug development and commercialization, the areas (of expertise) these people represent lie at the very heart of the most critical work force needs," Dahms said.  And there just aren't enough American college grads with the right skills to fill those jobs, he said.
The science foundation reports that as of 1999, about a quarter of all U.S. workers holding a doctorate in science or engineering were foreign-born.  For computer science and engineering doctorates, about 45 percent were foreign-born, and for biological sciences, 27 percent.
Some observers are queasy about the future supply of foreign expertise.
"You can't depend on it," Haseltine says.  "As economic conditions improve abroad, it's less likely these foreign workers will come to the United States.  We've already seen some reverse brain drain, back to China, back to Europe, back to Germany in particular," by people who've gotten years of training in the United States.
What's more, the allotted number of the H-1B visas is scheduled to be cut sharply next year, Dahms said.
The obvious response, Haseltine and others say, is to produce more Americans with science and engineering expertise.
So, if it's up to this country, how does it increase Americans' understanding of science?  The real engine, experts say, is the schoolroom.
Leno: "Who invented pasteurization?"
Kerry from Denver: "Um, some agriculture person … (from) Nebraska."
(Correct answer: French scientist Louis Pasteur.)
Nancy Ridenour, science department leader at Ithaca High School in Ithaca, N.Y., tells the story of two kindergarten teachers she visited.  Each presented the class with a large water pool that contained a toy boat.
One teacher asked, "What do you think would make this boat move?" Students suggested they could blow on it, squirt water on it or simply push it.  Then the teacher said, "Show me."
When the other teacher presented the same basic setup to her class, she simply said, "Here are some straws.  Blow on the boat and see if it moves."
For the students, "there were two different experiences," Ridenour says.
The first approach, which invited children to think rather than just follow instructions, teaches critical thinking through the process of inquiry, she said.  That's one way that Ridenour and others recommend to help kids learn more about science.
It has to start early.  Around fourth or fifth grade, "you go into the valley of the shadow," where pupils turn off to science and math unless they've experienced good classroom material, chances to explore the topic and "teachers who love the subject," said Judith Ramaley, with the science foundation's education and human resources section.
The foundation plans to spend about $1 billion over the next five years for its third generation of efforts over the past decade to improve science and math teaching, Ramaley said.
Among its priorities is better training in those subjects for teachers.  "It's very clear that teachers matter, and their knowledge of subject matter content is critical," Ramaley said.
Leno: "The largest organ on the human body is
Stephanie from New York: "Yours or mine?"
(Correct answer: The skin.)
Malcom and others say people certainly are capable of learning about science.  Her office develops science materials for people with poor general literacy.  "Our experience has been if you help them understand the significance of the topic and provide the information at a level they can engage with it, that they are very engaged," she said.
So the idea "that somehow people can't connect, I don't accept that.  They haven't failed me yet."
Miller, at Northwestern, says that people who get a good foundation in the classroom are poised to learn even more through the Internet.
"We are going to be in a period where adults who wish to know something and have a foundation of knowledge are going to be able to get that information quicker, at a higher quality and at less cost than ever in the history of humans," he said.
And the same technology should let a growing class of scientifically literate citizens take more control of science-related government debates by bombarding legislators with e-mail, he said.
If science literacy rises to 25 percent of adults in the next decade, Miller said, that means about 50 million people even by today's population.
And that, he says, will catch the attention of Capitol Hill.

EDITORIALS; Immigrants are crucial to U.S. job creation

The Trump administration's decision Tuesday to drop its cruel, chaos-creating plan to force international college students to leave the nation if they were only taking online courses because of the pandemic is great news for those students, their colleges and the U.S. economy. But the issues raised by the now-rescinded policy aren't going away any time soon. The hostility toward immigrants and potential immigrants by President Donald Trump and too many Americans needs to be addressed.
Yes, there are occasionally horror stories of Americans with tech jobs being forced to train lower-paid replacements with H-1B foreign employee visas. But the fact is that talented international workers allowed to get U.S. visas or citizenship create far more jobs than they take because of their outsized role in entrepreneurship.
It's not just South African-born Elon Musk. Forbes reported last year that 50 of 91 - 55% - of U.S. startup companies valued at $1 billion or more were launched by immigrants from 25 different nations. Immigrants also played crucial roles as members of management or product development teams at 23 of these startups launched by U.S. natives.
The reality is that these individuals didn't replace talented Americans. They hired them by the tens of thousands. Instead of sending international students home, the U.S. government should offer work visas to those with coveted job skills. The president is wrong. Immigration helps our nation enormously.

Leading Republicans on immigration

Republicans thought they were being so clever.  They were sure that replacing Trent Lott with the kinder and gentler Bill Frist would keep activists from storming the gates.  They forgot two things: Activists come in all flavors, and the gates can be stormed easily from the right.
His tenure as Senate majority leader has only just begun and already Frist is getting heat from right-wing groups who worry that he is not sufficiently anti-immigrant.
Bravo for Frist.  Just because many Republicans make fools of themselves by insisting that immigration is the ruin of the country -- even in the face of evidence that the country would be ruined without it -- this is no reason for the Tennessee senator to do likewise.
Besides, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was on to something when he insisted that history judge him by the enemies he made.  Frist should be so lucky.  His critics include an outfit called Americans for Better Immigration, which recently handed out report cards on all 535 members of Congress.  The grades were based on members' efforts to limit immigration as a way of curbing population growth.
Mind you, we're not talking here only about illegal immigration.  The real issue -- and the debate that those on the far right would really like to force -- is whether the United States should impose a moratorium on legal immigration.
On either score, according to the group, Frist is somewhat of an underachiever.  Since he first took office in 1995, Frist has done just enough to curb illegal immigration to earn a gentleman's "C." His efforts to curb immigration overall got him a "D."
The Harvard grad better watch out.  With grades like that, a fellow could get elected president.
According to the group, when it comes to reducing illegal immigration, 32 Republican senators got higher marks than Frist.  On reducing immigration overall, 39 GOP senators did better.
The organization insists that the Tennessee senator has been weak in curbing illegal immigration and limiting legal immigration.  It also says he has been less than diligent in opposing amnesty and imposing restrictions on "guest worker" programs so that indentured servants -- er, workers -- who are supposed to return to their home country really do leave.
Pity that Frist isn't more like Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado, the chair of the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus.  Tancredo has suggested dispatching soldiers to the U.S.-Mexico border and accused President Bush of being soft on national security with an "open-door" immigration policy.  He also recently tried to get a Denver-area honors student and his family deported after it was revealed that they were in the United States illegally.
Those deeds were enough to earn him an "A-plus" for his zero tolerance of illegal immigration.  Of course, the congressman also can keep an open mind as to the benefits of cheap labor.  He did so last fall when it was revealed that a drywall company he hired to remodel his Denver-area home had utilized illegal immigrant labor.  At the time, Tancredo said it wasn't his job to make sure that he wasn't -- even indirectly -- employing illegal immigrants.
Even as someone who believes that immigrants are perhaps America's most valuable import, the criticism of Frist seems exaggerated.  In 1996, Frist voted for a bill that barred identified illegal aliens from legal re-entry for 10 years and increased the size of the Border Patrol.
Four years later, he voted against an attempt by some to insert into a bill about H-1B visas (for high-skilled workers) language allowing amnesty for illegal immigrants from Central America.  In 2002, Frist voted for a homeland security measure intended to create a system to better identify and track visa holders.
Those are all reasonable positions, and Frist shouldn't give these critics the time of day.  In fact, while the Trent Lott affair probably hurt the GOP's efforts to appeal to black voters, Frist's measured approach to immigration reform may help Senate Republicans make inroads with another increasingly important constituency: Hispanics.
Of course, you can't please everyone.  And the fact that the new Senate majority leader is already such a disappointment to those on the anti-immigrant fringe confirms that he has the chance to do more than simply lead Republicans in the Senate.  On this issue, and perhaps on others, Frist is in a position to lead his party back to where it needs to be: the sensible center.

Q: What will be your top domestic and international priority in Congress?
A: Economic recovery is my top priority. We need businesses and schools to be both open and safe for our families. These goals are not mutually exclusive. As a technology entrepreneur, not a career politician, I have a track record of creating high-paying jobs. My goal is to secure the well-being of the American people and spirit through practical solutions that stimulate job growth.
The COVID-19 pandemic taught us many hard lessons. It showed that bigger government does not provide greater financial or personal security - businesses witness ever-changing regulations, and public health messages change daily. The pandemic will pass, but bad economic policies and over-regulation will make recovery harder. My opponent, Scott Peters, supports AB5 and voted for the PRO Act - two bills that make it illegal for thousands of workers to keep their jobs. At a time when San Diegans need more opportunities to supplement their income, Scott Peters is making it harder to make ends meet. I oppose both bills.
Strong international policy comes from a clear understanding of local needs. As a gateway to Asia - and with Tijuana sharing a border - San Diego has always been a gateway to our global economy. Today, the opportunities and challenges of global engagement are more pressing than ever. I am not only a lifelong San Diegan, but I also spent many years in China as the CEO of a tech company. I understand the global challenges that our community faces. In Congress, I plan on getting things done.
Q: Has the pandemic changed your approach to health care? If so, how?
A: This is my second pandemic. While living in China, I successfully ran a multinational company during SARS. I safely took care of employees by observing public health guidelines. Economic sacrifices do not need to be the norm in a pandemic; we can balance people's financial and physical well-being. My pandemic experience has focused me on four areas: speeding development of treatments, fostering insurance competition, creating transparency in pricing and rebuilding our strategic supply chain so that we are not so dramatically exposed to shortages as we have recently seen.
I am committed to our San Diego life-science community, the best in the world. Yet Scott Peters voted for HR3, a bill which could eliminate 80,000 jobs in life sciences and stall new drug discoveries, including a COVID-19 vaccine. How is this progress? Our supply chain is a mess. We are dependent on China; there is nothing sensible about that. It has exposed the U.S. to strategic shortages for personal protective equipment supplies and generic drugs. We must bring manufacturing back home and be prepared for the next pandemic. We need to foster competitive insurance coverage across state lines that includes pre-existing conditions and lowers costs. Single-payer health care run by the government would explode costs and damage the standard of care. Centralized control restricting freedom of choice is not the answer. Finally, regarding congressional perks, I believe all members of Congress should use the VA health care system. Do not be surprised how quickly care for our veterans would improve.
Q: What more could Congress do to combat climate change?
A: Environmental alarmism delivers headlines, not solutions. Many proposals like the Green New Deal and others supported by my opponent are unrealistic and economically disastrous. Rather than playing the politics of climate, I am focused on practical, common sense solutions that reverse human impact. These include carbon capture technologies, bluetech biofuels and other market driven incentives.
I strongly support measures that ensure clean air and clean water, and support the goal to meet 100 percent of our power demand through clean, renewable and zero-emission energy resources. Energy means progress. Yet California's blackouts are the result of bad policy and unintended consequences, more reflective of an emerging nation than the world's fifth-largest economy. It is not necessary to sacrifice our standard of living. I have found a way to achieve carbon reduction through marketplace solutions. I am the co-inventor of mobile check deposit used by 80 million Americans. It has saved an estimated 11 million tons of carbon emissions and counting. I have driven successful innovation throughout my career. While my opponent talks climate, I have acted. The 52nd district is home to the world's leading research, desalination, energy and scientific minds. However, we lack an effective voice in Congress. We must commit to public-private partnerships that accelerate transition to sustainable forms of alternative energy that are proven, scalable and affordable. I will champion our district's technology innovation for the benefit of all.
Q: What changes would you make to U.S. immigration policy?
A: I strongly support policies fostering legal immigration and welcome our new citizens. We are a nation of immigrants. We refresh our talent and gain new ideas by attracting the best and the brightest, the strongest and the most determined. I am the grandson of immigrants and son of World War II veterans who began with little more than a dream. I believe in immigration. However, our immigration system is broken. Congress has failed to act, and my opponent refuses to distinguish between people who obey our laws and those who violate them. Waves of illegal immigration increase horrific human trafficking while suppressing wages for working Americans. Every democratic nation has borders to protect its citizens. They must be enforced to be effective. Let us speed the legal immigration process, removing bureaucratic barriers and restoring our proud immigration heritage. As your congressman, I will work to enact sensible immigration and asylum policies that end the gaming of our laws; increase H-1B visas to attract Ph.D. technical talent to grow our industries and prosperity for all Americans; and increase border security by using technology and meaningful barriers to stem the flow of illegal crossings.
Q: How would you address the massive national debt hanging over America's future?
A: America's runaway debt equals the size of our economy: $27 trillion. China owns $1.1 trillion of U.S. debt, and every American owes $70,043 as their share. My opponent and his party want to massively increase our debt, promoting a multi-trillion-dollar spending spree to win favor in an election year. This is both unsustainable and unconscionable. Balancing a budget is a big part of creating productive jobs. The outrageous federal deficit spending must end. Crushing debt saps our national vitality and mortgages our children's future. During the eight years Scott Peters has been in Congress, the government has shut down three times and the debt ceiling has been raised above the legal limit nine times. Shutdowns and deficits cost American taxpayers billions of dollars in lost wages and opportunity. Yet Congress keeps their perks as our country suffers. We Californians are already taxed at the highest rate in the nation, compounded by federal taxes. First, we must stop the bleeding and pass balanced budgets every year. I propose stripping Congress of its paychecks until a balanced budget is passed to avoid any more shutdowns. Second, as Americans live and work longer, we need to provide balanced reform to put Social Security on long-term, financially firm ground. Lastly, we need to fix our costly and inefficient healthcare system, which harms Medicare recipients and drains our savings.
Q: Why should voters choose you over your opponent in this election?
A: I am Jim DeBello, a successful business leader, not a career politician. While Congress talks about jobs, I have created them. When Scott Peters talks about climate, I have delivered solutions. I understand important issues that affect our daily lives - the impact of skyrocketing homelessness, the rising cost of living and the vital need for public safety. I am an advocate for all independent-minded voters whose voices are not being heard. Our current representative has demonstrated neither passion nor performance. San Diego has changed; we are a dynamic hub of innovation, diverse businesses, with military and veteran needs. I bring experience that meets the demands for the 21st century. I co-invented mobile check deposit; it represents the kind of practical solutions I will bring to elevate our future. I have run companies in six countries and am an expert on foreign trade, data privacy and U.S.-China relations. These are critical issues that impact our nation and our community every day. We are not a racist country, but we must work to ensure equality and justice for all, and act on our principles. I am against California's Proposition 16 that would allow discrimination and preferential treatment and will work to keep discrimination out of laws in Washington. We must rebuild our economy, improve education and restore faith in the American Dream. I will deliver real solutions. Vote for change. Help me turn visionary ideas into genuine action. I would be honored to represent you and receive your vote.

Extension of higher visa quotas not needed; Program was established for skilled tech workers

WASHINGTON -- The tech industry, which three years ago won a major increase in H-1B visas to bring in skilled foreign workers, has decided not to seek an extension when the higher limit expires next month.
The move may be linked to a growing trend of sending service jobs to facilities located abroad.
Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, said congressional allies have advised him that they won't be able to take action on the visas before Oct. 1, when the H-1B quota drops from 195,000 a year to its previous level of 65,000.
"It's obviously a tough time to ask Congress to vote on the immigration provision when the unemployment rate remains somewhat high," said Miller, whose trade group has been the leading proponent for the temporary visas.
"The economy is obviously in a much different place today than it was three years ago" when the limit was raised to its current level, Miller said.  However, he said his organization would be prepared to ask Congress to increase the quota next spring if the economy rebounds.
The H-1B visa was set up to allow skilled specialty workers, such as computer programers, nurses and fashion models, to relieve labor shortages in the United States.  The program was expanded in 2000 after tech companies argued that they faced a severe shortage of skilled labor.
Since then, the H-1B has continued to spur controversy, especially after the dot-com bubble burst, leading to the layoffs of thousands of workers.
Use of the visa has been declining since 2001. The Homeland Security Department's immigration service reported last week that during the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, the government approved roughly 57,000 H-1B visas, putting it far below the pace to reach the annual cap.
Critics of the H-1B program were uncertain whether the waning interest in the H-1B visa quota was good news or bad.
"We definitely think it should drop back to its historical level of 65,000, which it is scheduled to do," said Chris McManes, spokesman for the Institute of IEEE-U.S.A., a division of the Institute Electrical and Electronic Engineers.
However, he said companies may be less interested in importing labor because they are sending more white-collar work abroad.
"I think a lot of companies are saying it might be cheaper and better for public relations to just send the work overseas," McManes said.
Although tracking the movement of jobs abroad is difficult, the Forrester Research firm recently produced a report projecting that 3.3 million service jobs will move offshore by 2015.
Miller said that some of the commentary on the shift has been overstated.  "Moving offshore began 20 years ago," he said, adding that his group estimates that about 3 percent of jobs are moving out of the country to places such as Mexico, Ireland, India and Canada.
He said that reducing the number of visas for specialized workers coming to the United States could speed up the transfer of jobs abroad.
"If we stop bringing (temporary skilled workers) into the country, the trend to move offshore would accelerate," he said, adding that if a company "can't get the foreign labor" here, then it will seek the lowest price from a contractor abroad.
Even if the industry does not push for visa legislation, Congress is now considering new restrictions for both the H-1B and another temporary work visa, the L-1, which was set up to allow international companies to bring workers with unique skills from abroad for limited stays.
U.S. workers have testified to Congress that their employers have hired contractors who bring in cheap foreign labor under L-1 visas to replace much higher-paid Americans.
Miller's group is seeking to avoid any new L-1 legislation.  He said he would be meeting next week with the Homeland Security Department to ask the administration to tighten enforcement of existing law instead.

48TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; Stephen Houlahan: I will strengthen our economy

Q: What will be your top domestic and international priority in Congress?
A: My top domestic priority is to strengthen our economy. The current rate of inflation is unacceptable, and I will address the root cause. While unemployment is down to 3.6 percent, those who are working are not reaping the benefits of having jobs. Prices, especially at the gas pump, are skyrocketing. Corporations are unfairly profiting from this situation. Some wealthy corporations pay little to no taxes at all, leaving the middle class to pay higher taxes to cover the shortfall. As a member of Congress, I will lead a bipartisan effort to protect consumers from price-gouging. I will also work to make the tax system fairer.
My top international priority is protecting our country from terrorism and war by ensuring our country's armed forces are strong. The best ways to address this are by enhancing our intelligence and collaboration with allies, in addition to having a well-equipped military. I will work on a bipartisan basis to defend our nation, as it is the prime responsibility of government under our Constitution.
Q: What more can Congress do to combat climate change?
A: As your member of Congress, I will combat climate change by protecting wildlands, rivers, estuaries and the ocean from harmful uses. I will protect the backcountry of East County from urban sprawl and large wind and solar farms. The Cleveland National Forest must be a protected water shed, for public recreation, not permanent housing or industrial level power generation.
Furthermore, I will create subsidies for microgrids, rather than industrial-scale production. We must reduce wildfire-causing wires strung across miles of wildlands that are subject to damage by high winds during East County's annual Santa Ana events.
Q: How should the United States handle the growing number of refugees and asylum seekers from Ukraine, Afghanistan, Central and South America and elsewhere?
A: I support the U.S. fulfilling its obligations, having promised to accept Afghan refugees who had helped our military in the recently concluded 20-year war in Afghanistan.
We must also honor our pledge to allow entry of at least 100,000 Ukrainian refugees displaced by the Russian invasion.
Those who wish to enter from Central and South America may be eligible to enter under the legal definition of asylum seekers, or under other current laws. These laws must be enforced, but I support increasing resources to immigration courts to more efficiently process the long lines of persons fleeing persecution in their home countries.
The only way to reduce the flow of asylum seekers driven to our southern border is to provide economic incentives to those nations to protect their citizens from lawlessness, persecution and poverty. Organized terror drives people to our southern border. Using economic incentives and pressures is the only way the refugee issue will be permanently resolved.
The U.S. needs more workers than the current birth rate provides to support the economy with the necessary labor workforce. Therefore, I support current law which allows entry of people in these areas that need workers, under the green card program, which allows permanent resident status, and under the H-1B visa program, which allows temporary employment of workers with college degrees.
Q: How would you try to improve border wait times for personal and commercial crossers at the U.S.-Mexico border?
A: U.S. goods and services trade with Mexico totaled an estimated $677.3 billion in 2019, with San Diego County's ports of entry being among the nation's busiest. We can do better to reduce wait times at the border. Reducing crossing and wait times at the border will help prevent trade costs that are passed on to the American consumer.
My solution is to deploy automated technologies and improved systems designed to speed up the crossing process. Technology providing notification of border wait times will allow travelers to make well informed decisions. Dynamic toll pricing models should be based on border wait and crossing times. Additionally, commercial truck segmentation will streamline traffic.
I will work to reduce wait times for those enrolled in the Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection (SENTRI) program, which allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers.
Q: How would you address economic pressures facing Americans with high inflation, gas prices and other costs and how would you address the massive national debt clouding America's future?
A: The only way to address the economic pressures facing Americans is for our leaders to make sound fiscal decisions that transcend partisan politics and special interests.
When I vote on the version of the budget produced by the House Budget Committee, I will consider it with an eye toward deficit reduction. This means that I must work with others in Congress to cut excessive expenditures. Growth in gross domestic product will also ease the economic pressure, but it requires reinvestment in infrastructure and subsidization of emerging technologies.
There are four candidates on the June 7 ballot in the campaign for the newly redrawn 48th Congressional District that represents much of East County. Republican Rep. Darrell Issa is being challenged by registered nurse Stephen Houlahan and community volunteer Matthew G. Rascon, both Democrats, and entertainment industry technician Lucinda Jahn, a no-party preference candidate. The top two vote-getters will advance to a Nov. 8 runoff. The San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board sent each candidate a 12-question survey, and  we are publishing partial responses today.

Skilled work visas reduced; Program had provided tech companies with labor in dot-com boom

Just a few years ago, U.S. technology companies were clamoring to drastically increase the number of skilled immigrants who could enter the country with a temporary work permit known as an H-1B visa.
Congress obliged by roughly doubling the number of new H-1B visas to a maximum of 195,000 a year, effective Oct. 1, 2000.
But the increase was short-lived.  As of yesterday, the cap on H-1B visas reverted to 65,000 -- with hardly a peep coming from once-vociferous tech industry groups.
So has the H-1B program become a non-issue?
"I don't know if I would call it a non-issue," said Thom Stohler of the AeA, a trade association formerly known as the American Electronics Association.  "There is a difference between the industry not lobbying and it being a non-issue."
With the changes in homeland security that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- and with the tech industry still in recovery -- industry experts say the political climate for the H-1B program couldn't be much cooler.
"There is just no strong case that industry can make when the unemployment rate is at 6 percent, and by some accounts might be even higher," Stohler said.  "That's just political reality."
Still, Peter Larrabee, a San Diego attorney who specializes in immigration law, predicts the H-1B program will become a hot issue again by next spring.
While the overall number of H-1B visa holders hired by the high-tech industry declined more than 60 percent in 2002, Larrabee noted the total number of H-1B visas issued in 2002 -- 79,100 -- was still well above the new 65,000 cap that took effect yesterday.
Larrabee said he has already deducted roughly 22,000 from the new total of 65,000 for H-1B applications that are currently pending.  He subtracted an additional 6,400 for H-1B visas the State Department recently pledged in treaties with Singapore and Chile -- and found that left only 36,600 H-1B visas for the rest of the world over the next 12 months.
"It means we're going to run out of H-1B visas after the first of the year," Larrabee said.  "It's going to become a critical issue again, probably in the next 120 to 180 days."
Unfortunately, Larrabee added, nobody in Congress is remotely interested in taking up the cause.
"We've been sent a neon-flashing sign that says 'Don't Bother,' " Larrabee said.  "We know there is absolutely no one on the Hill who's willing to take up this gauntlet and waste their political capital.  Their message is, if the economy changes and things happen, we'll deal with it manana.  And that's exactly what's happening."
That may be true, but it's only part of the story, according to labor and professional groups like the Institute of IEEE-USA, a division of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.
Such critics say many companies may be less interested in boosting the number of H-1B workers because they have exported thousands of white-collar jobs to low-cost operations in India, the Philippines and elsewhere.
Although tracking the shift of jobs abroad is difficult, the Forrester Research firm recently produced a report projecting that 3.3 million service jobs will move offshore by 2015.
The H-1B program refers to a provision of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act that allows highly skilled foreigners to work in the United States for as long as six years.
Section H-1B of the law allows foreign workers with the equivalent of a college degree to work in highly skilled occupations that require specialized knowledge.
Most H-1B visas have been granted to computer programmers, engineers and other high-tech workers.  The demand for such workers couldn't be met during the dot-com boom, which was the biggest reason that technology companies cited in 1998, when they began lobbying to expand the H-1B ceiling.
Though Congress had raised the H-1B ceiling to 115,000 annually in 1999 and 2000, thousands of foreign immigrants were still left on waiting lists, and technology companies continued to agitate for higher quotas.
Yet in 2001, when the H-1B ceiling went to 195,000, immigration officials granted just 163,200 visas under the program, according to the Bureau of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.  In 2002, the numbers fell even further, to 79,100.
How the changes will affect technology companies in San Diego is difficult to assess.
A Qualcomm spokeswoman said the telecommunications giant is still hiring, "and a small percentage" of those positions will go to foreign workers with H-1B visas.
At Science Applications International Corp., spokesman Ron Zollars said there are 136 employees working on H-1B visas.  But Zollars said SAIC has little concern over the reduction in the number of foreign workers who may enter and work in the United States under an H-1B visa.
Given the nature of SAIC's work on military and classified programs, and the fact that 70 percent of its revenue comes from government customers, "we have limited opportunities for employees on non-immigrant visas," Zollars said.  "A great deal of that work contains data/information that is only accessible by U.S. citizens."

Immigration law allows temporary visas
The provision that allows certain foreigners to work in the United States for as long as six years is in section H-1B of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
The provision allows foreign workers with the equivalent of a college degree in a highly skilled occupation that requires specialized knowledge to work in the United States for up to three years.  Section H-1B also provides for a three-year extension.
American technology companies lobbied Congress to dramatically increase the limit on H-1B visas when their industry was booming in the late 1990s. Congress raised the ceiling to195,000 annually for three years, but applications fell short of the cap after the tech industry crashed.

EDITORIALS; Two visa messes reflect terribly on the U.S.

The visa system - built on the requirement that people from more than 150 nations obtain visas to travel to, enter and remain in the United States - is struggling on two fronts.
The first has to do with basic competence. One year after the U.S. relaxed pandemic rules to allow fully vaccinated inbound international air travelers, wait times for tourist visa applicant interviews averaging 400-plus days are causing angst both among those who want to come to America and in the U.S. visitor industry, which warns that the U.S. is on track to lose nearly 7 million visitors and $12 billion in projected spending in 2023. Locally, on Friday, the State Department estimated there was a 626-day wait time for tourist visa interviews at its Tijuana consulate. The problem has been clear all year but has been met with indifference by the Biden administration. The parallels with its tolerance of endless delays at the Tijuana-San Diego border are plain.
The second visa crisis has to do with self-defeating U.S. immigration policies. More than 88,000 workers at tech companies have been laid off this year, with 20,000 in Silicon Valley losing their jobs in one week last month, many at Twitter and Facebook parent Meta. Exact numbers are hard to come by, but many thousands of these workers - admitted to the U.S. on H-1B visas which allow U.S. firms to bring in foreign workers in high-skill occupations - face a 60-day deadline to either find a comparable job, obtain another visa or leave the country. This will force talented workers who have built lives in the U.S. and want to stay here to leave. Perversely, this comes just months after President Joe Biden and Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to boost domestic production of semiconductor chips and help other tech industries. This forced exodus also looms despite the fact that there are at least 800,000 tech vacancies in the U.S. These sorts of U.S. immigration policies are simultaneously cruel and incoherent. There has to be a better way.

Skilled work visas reduced; Program had provided tech companies with labor in dot-com boom

Just a few years ago, U.S. technology companies were clamoring to drastically increase the number of skilled immigrants who could enter the country with a temporary work permit known as an H-1B visa. Congress obliged by roughly doubling the number of new H-1B visas to a maximum of 195,000 a year, effective Oct. 1, 2000. But the increase was short-lived.
As of yesterday, the cap on H-1B visas reverted to 65,000 -- with hardly a peep coming from once-vociferous tech industry groups. So has the H-1B program become a non-issue? "I don't know if I would call it a non-issue," said Thom Stohler of the AeA, a trade association formerly known as the American Electronics Association.
"There is a difference between the industry not lobbying and it being a non-issue." With the changes in homeland security that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- and with the tech industry still in recovery -- industry experts say the political climate for the H-1B program couldn't be much cooler. "There is just no strong case that industry can make when the unemployment rate is at 6 percent, and by some accounts might be even higher," Stohler said.
"That's just political reality." Still, Peter Larrabee, a San Diego attorney who specializes in immigration law, predicts the H-1B program will become a hot issue again by next spring. While the overall number of H-1B visa holders hired by the high-tech industry declined more than 60 percent in 2002, Larrabee noted the total number of H-1B visas issued in 2002 -- 79,100 -- was still well above the new 65,000 cap that took effect yesterday. Larrabee said he has already deducted roughly 22,000 from the new total of 65,000 for H-1B applications that are currently pending.
He subtracted an additional 6,400 for H-1B visas the State Department recently pledged in treaties with Singapore and Chile -- and found that left only 36,600 H-1B visas for the rest of the world over the next 12 months. "It means we're going to run out of H-1B visas after the first of the year," Larrabee said.
"It's going to become a critical issue again, probably in the next 120 to 180 days." Unfortunately, Larrabee added, nobody in Congress is remotely interested in taking up the cause. "We've been sent a neon-flashing sign that says `Don't Bother,' " Larrabee said.
"We know there is absolutely no one on the Hill who's willing to take up this gauntlet and waste their political capital.
Their message is, if the economy changes and things happen, we'll deal with it manana.
And that's exactly what's happening." That may be true, but it's only part of the story, according to labor and professional groups like the Institute of IEEE-USA, a division of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers. Such critics say many companies may be less interested in boosting the number of H-1B workers because they have exported thousands of white-collar jobs to low-cost operations in India, the Philippines and elsewhere. Although tracking the shift of jobs abroad is difficult, the Forrester Research firm recently produced a report projecting that 3.3 million service jobs will move offshore by 2015. The H-1B program refers to a provision of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act that allows highly skilled foreigners to work in the United States for as long as six years. Section H-1B of the law allows foreign workers with the equivalent of a college degree to work in highly skilled occupations that require specialized knowledge. Most H-1B visas have been granted to computer programmers, engineers and other high-tech workers.
The demand for such workers couldn't be met during the dot-com boom, which was the biggest reason that technology companies cited in 1998, when they began lobbying to expand the H-1B ceiling. Though Congress had raised the H-1B ceiling to 115,000 annually in 1999 and 2000, thousands of foreign immigrants were still left on waiting lists, and technology companies continued to agitate for higher quotas. Yet in 2001, when the H-1B ceiling went to 195,000, immigration officials granted just 163,200 visas under the program, according to the Bureau of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
In 2002, the numbers fell even further, to 79,100. How the changes will affect technology companies in San Diego is difficult to assess. A Qualcomm spokeswoman said the telecommunications giant is still hiring, "and a small percentage" of those positions will go to foreign workers with H-1B visas. At Science Applications International Corp., spokesman Ron Zollars said there are 136 employees working on H-1B visas.
But Zollars said SAIC has little concern over the reduction in the number of foreign workers who may enter and work in the United States under an H-1B visa. Given the nature of SAIC's work on military and classified programs, and the fact that 70 percent of its revenue comes from government customers, "we have limited opportunities for employees on non-immigrant visas," Zollars said.
"A great deal of that work contains data/information that is only accessible by U.S. citizens." Bruce Bigelow: (619) 293-1314; bruce.bigelow@uniontrib.com Immigration law allows temporary visas The provision that allows certain foreigners to work in the United States for as long as six years is in section H-1B of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The provision allows foreign workers with the equivalent of a college degree in a highly skilled occupation that requires specialized knowledge to work in the United States for up to three years.
Section H-1B also provides for a three-year extension. American technology companies lobbied Congress to dramatically increase the limit on H-1B visas when their industry was booming in the late 1990s. Congress raised the ceiling to195,000 annually for three years, but applications fell short of the cap after the tech industry crashed.

GAO sees need for scrutiny of workers with special visas

WASHINGTON -- The Homeland Security Department needs to keep a closer eye on the high-tech workers admitted to the United States under a special visa program, congressional investigators said yesterday.
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said the new department should keep track of when foreign workers admitted with what are known as H-1B visas enter and leave the country, and develop rules for how long workers who lose their jobs are allowed to remain in the country.
"Much of the information needed to effectively oversee the H-1B visa program is not available," the GAO said.
The Homeland Security Department agreed with the recommendations.
With the strong support of the high-tech industry, Congress has authorized hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to obtain the visas and obtain jobs in the United States.  They can stay for up to six years.  Unions have fought the program, saying that companies should train U.S. workers to fill those positions.
In the last three budget years, 195,000 of these visas could be handed out each year.  In the budget year that began Wednesday, that number dropped to 65,000 a year.
With the economic downturn, 400,000 of these foreign workers lost their jobs in the last two years, the GAO said.  The number of workers coming to the United States dropped dramatically.  And only 40 percent of those hired in 2003 were working in the high-tech industry, as compared with 65 percent in 2000.

Foreign-worker visa cap met in 1 day; H-1B applications top 65,000 annual quota

Although many U.S. job-seekers are looking for work after the economy's so-called "jobless recovery," demand for foreign workers is so high that the government ran out of a year's worth of special work visas in just one day last week.
Last Friday -- at the beginning of the federal fiscal year -- the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services stopped taking applications for H-1B worker visas, which are intended for foreign workers in such specialized professions as engineering, medicine and computer programming.
The government is allowed to issue up to 65,000 such visas each year. By the end of the day Friday, the immigration service had received enough applications to meet that quota. It will not accept any more applications, although it will consider those filed before Friday.
It was the first time in the history of the H-1B program that the annual quota had been depleted in just one day.
High-tech companies, which hire most H-1B workers, said the surge in demand shows that lawmakers should consider expanding the program, which once allowed as many as 195,000 visas before it was dropped to 65,000 last year.
"San Diego's been directly affected by the lack of H-1Bs," said Kevin Carroll, who heads the local chapter of the AeA, formerly known as the American Electronics Association.
Carroll said he has talked to at least three technology companies that had H-1B applications on the line and were denied.
"A couple times a month, I hear from companies that would have liked to have brought talent across from overseas but have not been able to because of the limits of the H-1B system," he said.
But U.S.-born high-tech workers complain that the visas allow companies to push down wages by injecting younger foreign workers into the workplace. Russ Harrison, legislative representative for the IEEE-USA, a unit of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, says the program "discourages employment of American workers."
Under the H-1B program, U.S. employers must pay foreign workers the prevailing wage for their job fields and show that qualified U.S. workers are not being passed over. The foreign worker must have at least a bachelor's degree or the equivalent.
H-1Bvisas, designed to allow U.S. firms to temporarily hire college-educated foreign workers, became popular during the late 1990s, when high-tech firms were ramping up their work forces during the height of the dot-com boom.
In 2000, Congress raised the cap on visas from 65,000 to 195,000. But it slashed the number back to 65,000 last October, partly to invigorate the then-shaky U.S. job market and partly because of Homeland Security concerns about foreign workers taking sensitive positions in the high-tech and biotech sectors.
"This has become a sensitive issue because security has gotten all wrapped up in it," Carroll said. "Homeland security has changed the dynamics of the debate. Our needs for H-1B workers are still the same, but the atmosphere for being aggressive on the issue has changed."
Some Republican lawmakers are pushing to loosen the cap on H-1Bs. Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas have proposed that foreign students graduating from master's or doctoral programs at U.S. universities should not be counted against the H-1B limit. They say such students could end up working for global competitors if they cannot get H-1Bvisas.
"So many positions in local companies are held by foreign doctoral students who would like to stay in San Diego," said Martha Dennis, venture partner at Windward Ventures and president of the San Diego Telecom Council. "We're going to have a lot of challenges if we lose this talent to other countries."
But legislative analysts doubt that any proposal to expand H-1B visas will get anywhere in Congress during the election season, when jobs and the economy remain high on voters' minds.

Immigration puzzle; Republicans ponder how best to respond

Republicans are in a tough spot when it comes to the issue of illegal immigration. Actually, make that several tough spots.
First of all, Republicans have to referee the shoving match between pro-business conservatives who want cheap labor, and pro-law-and-order conservatives who want all illegal immigrants rounded up and deported.
Then, they have to strike the right tone between addressing the concerns of those Americans who feel the United States has lost control of its borders, without coming across to many as closed-minded restrictionists.
Then, they have to sift through the good, bad and the ugly of nearly a dozen pieces of legislation in the House and Senate, many of which don't sound all that much different from the rest, which raises the question, "Can't some of these Republican-sponsored bills be blended together?"
Also, they need to steer clear of the familiar scourge of nativism, where the argument becomes not just that people are coming illegally but that the wrong kind of people are coming, people who are inferior or otherwise deficient in some way. We've traveled this road before, and it's a dead-end.
The good news for Republicans is that there are some bright lights in this debate. One of the brightest is Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman, who recently brought up the subject of immigration in a speech to the Republican Governors Association in Carlsbad.
The RNC chairman stressed the importance of protecting our borders, but he also did something that those who like to talk about curbing illegal immigration often forget to do. He praised the contributions of immigrants to our economy and society, and he denounced those who behave as if "coming to these shores was a right reserved only for them and their ancestors but not for others." Those people included Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge who, Mehlman recalled, called in 1905 for cracking down on immigration because it damaged "the quality of our citizenship."
Bravo for Mehlman. That's one of the problems with how Republicans approach this issue. They love to talk about coming down hard on illegal immigrants. But they never make it to part 2, where they acknowledge the rightful contributions of immigrants.
In fact, Republicans such as Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., go so far as to support curbs on legal immigration, including the elimination of H-1B visas often used by technology professionals from India, China and other countries.
Changing that policy would be a big mistake. Often, it is immigrants with their hard work and optimism who revitalize an industry or even a whole segment of the economy. If the issue is illegal immigration, then leave it at that. Going after legal immigrants as well only helps feed suspicions that what this is really about is a dislike of foreigners.
If Republicans want to have a say on this issue -- and clearly, they do -- they have to strike a balancing act. They can and should talk about protecting the nation's borders, but they also have to draw the line at nativism and show that they understand that immigrants are one of this country's most valuable imports.

Missed chances; Immigration bill doesn't go far enough
The San Diego Union-Tribune
December 20, 2005 Tuesday

It's a shame that much of the political discourse in this country is cast in absolute, black-and-white, all-or-nothing terms, leaving little room for nuance, middle ground or thoughtful disagreement.
That's true in the immigration debate. And make no mistake, despite the claims of some, this is a debate over immigration as a whole and not just over illegal immigration. What else could it be when members of Congress such as Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., propose a moratorium on legal immigration and an end to H-1B visas, which allow high-tech workers to enter the country legally?
Predictably, there was not much nuance or middle ground or thoughtful disagreement in the debate surrounding the Border Protection, Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005. That's the enforcement-heavy immigration reform bill proposed by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., and Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., and approved last week by the House by a vote of 239 to 182. Rather, the debate over the bill was about what we've come to expect from the immigration discussion, complete with partisanship and plenty of hysterics and hyperbole on both sides.
In the end, however, there was good news and bad.
The good news is that a lot of the bill seems reasonable enough. Some of the more sensible provisions included language converting one's being in the country illegally from a civil infraction to a criminal offense, a mandate to build 700 miles of fence along high-traffic areas of the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican border (as opposed to along the entire border), and a requirement that employers verify the legal status of their workers or face stiff penalties.
The bad news is that the bill skirts the thorny issue of what to do with the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already here, that it makes the mistake of trying to enlist local law enforcement officers in controlling illegal immigration, and that it puts too heavy an emphasis on enforcement alone while ignoring the economic forces that inspire people to cross the border in the first place.
The bill also flirted with the profoundly un-American concept of denying U.S. citizenship to babies born to illegal immigrants -- in violation of the 14th Amendment. Thankfully, House leaders refused to allow a vote on that toxic proposal, perhaps out of concern that it could torpedo the entire bill.
Overall, despite its sensible approach to some issues, the bill has to be characterized as a missed opportunity. Illegal immigration is a real problem, and it calls out for real world solutions. And you don't get there by burying your head in the sand about why people are coming and what needs to be done about those who are already here.
Usually, half a loaf is better than none. But not when it comes to immigration reform. There, it only leaves you feeling hungry.

Half a plan; Call to revive science, tech omits visa fixes

Perhaps the single part of President Bush's State of the Union address to win the most bipartisan praise was his call for a 10-year, $136 billion plan to boost scientific research and development funding, improve science and mathematics education, and increase the number of U.S. science and mathematics graduates. The proposal followed many of the recommendations of a recent National Academy of Sciences report by a high-powered list of scholars and corporate executives that warned America is doomed to a lower standard of living unless it repairs its "eroding" status as the world's leader in science and technology.
Given the starkness of the economic threat facing the United States, the president's initiative is welcome and overdue. But there is a big step he also could take that would produce dramatic results much more quickly: launching an all-out push to attract brilliant foreign scientists, engineers and mathematicians to the United States and to encourage top foreign students who are studying here to stay here after graduation.
Until the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, visas for outstanding foreign students and graduates were not particularly difficult to come by. But in the years since, the U.S. government -- trying to screen out potential terrorists -- has put up far more obstacles.
Yet assuaging our national-security fears has put our economic security at risk. Between the visa obstacles, the perception of a rise in U.S. nativism and the eagerness of other nations to ramp up their own high-tech economies, the number of foreign students at top U.S. research universities is down.
Last spring, Microsoft founder Bill Gates called this official hostility to the world's best and brightest -- especially the limits on temporary H-1B visas for technology workers -- a huge and growing drag on the U.S. economy.
Some on Capitol Hill heeded Gates, but not enough. In December, the House blocked a Senate plan to add 30,000 H-1B visas annually. Representatives proved unable to distinguish between illegal immigrants and those with specialized skills whom we should badly want here.
President Bush should have denounced this economic know-nothingism in his State of the Union speech. It would have been in line with his frequent rebukes of immigrant-bashers.
But if Bush wants to avoid a direct confrontation with the House over the issue, he could still put his shoulder behind two of the National Academy of Sciences' other recommendations instead of touting the Senate's visa plan.
The first would provide an automatic one-year visa extension to foreign students who receive doctorates in science, technology, mathematics or engineering.
The second would reorient our immigration policies to give far more preference to applicants with doctoral-level science and engineering skills.
Taking such stands likely would inflame both the nativists on the right who see all immigration as bad and the labor unions and their allies on the left who think U.S. workers need protection from foreign talent. But if President Bush is the bold, visionary leader his admirers claim, then this is what he will do.
After all, it will be an utterly hollow victory if, in 10 years time, the U.S. school system starts producing far more scientists and engineers for an economy that no longer has jobs for them. Perhaps our best and brightest could emigrate to New Delhi or Shanghai.

Expanding H-1B visas won't solve problem
Your Feb. 2 editorial "Half a plan Call to revive science, tech omits visa fixes" unfairly criticizes President Bush and entirely misses the point of the educational initiative.
Our economy does not need the quick fix of the liberalized immigration policy you advocate. The wiser, long-term goal is to develop American engineering and science talent and create the educational environment that fosters this development. To shortsightedly provide welfare benefits to transnational corporations that turn their backs on this nation is foolish.
National security is a vital goal that should not be sacrificed to the greed of self-interested globalists. "Brilliant, foreign" scientists, trained at Western universities, are busy developing nuclear menace in Korea and Iran as I write.
If the crop of American engineers and scientists envisioned by Bush finds itself without employment in the future, the cause will not be our failure to liberally expand the H-1B program. Rather, the blame will justly fall with the corporations that are currently investing billions in technology infrastructure in other countries. The future of our children depends on our government encouraging capitalists to capitalize America.

Attorneys faulted in fake clemency letters
Regarding "Clemency letters forged, officials say" (News, Feb. 11):
Michael Morales was convicted of raping and killing a girl and is facing execution next week. His attorneys have had 25 years to appeal the case before every court in the country. All the judges found there were valid legal reasons to believe he committed those horrid acts. The only recourse Morales now has is clemency from the governor.
As part of the clemency package, attorneys David Senior and Ken Starr submitted letters from some of the jurors who had convicted Morales. Those signed letters supported clemency for Morales. Thank goodness the district attorney from Ventura and the Attorney General's Office sent investigators out to seek the truth. The jurors said they didn't sign the letters. That makes the letters forgeries!
Starr at least has had the smarts to shut up and make himself unavailable until more is known. The first thing out of Senior's mouth was an accusation against the investigators who uncovered the forgeries. Until he provides the contact information for the signers of those letters, I am forced to think that Senior has the same respect for the truth as does Morales.

On pot, for whom is Horn speaking?
I am somewhat amused at Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Horn's recent remarks in his state of the county address. Specifically, he stated that "the state has ordered us to issue identification cards that let people buy and use marijuana. That violates federal law."
Horn then states that the county is "standing up for our constituents, and we are asking the courts to support this decision" to bring suit to drop that order.
Would he please explain how his objection to the use of medical marijuana, which was approved by 65 percent of Californians in Proposition 215, constitutes standing up for his constituents? Are we to assume that Horn represents only a small minority of voters?

Aging levees should be concern for all
"Sacramento Delta in decline" (News, Feb. 5) points out the problems connected with the more than 1,000 miles of aging levees and pumps in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta area.
A number of geologic and hydrologic factors contribute to what could become a catastrophic failure that would seriously damage both the ecosystem and economy of the state. The western part of the delta is underlain by earthquake faults that are overdue for a major seismic event.
Levees have been built to create farmland, resulting in areas now well below sea level. Scouring of the levees occurs whenever copious winter rains cause flooding. Saltwater intrusion from the west clearly threatens the drinking water and irrigation water. The California Department of Water Resources states that up to $5 billion in upgrades to the old levees is necessary.
About one-third of San Diego County's water comes from the delta area. Although water storage capacity is improving in the county, it will not be completely upgraded for at least another five years. Desalination negotiations are reportedly at a standstill. Groundwater levels are low despite last year's abundant rainfall. Remember the five- or six-year dry period we experienced prior to last year. Keep in mind that our current winter might set a record for scant rainfall.

Thank Gene Polley for mute button
Thanks for publishing "TV remote's father doesn't click for all Creation overshadowed by a colleague's gizmo" (News, Feb. 5) on my dad, Gene Polley, who invented the wireless remote control almost exactly 50 years ago. Given that there was no mute button anywhere until he decided there was a need for one, I cannot imagine how anyone can dispute that he was truly the "Father of Remote Control."
There are few inventions that have had the worldwide impact the remote control continues to have in society.
I am glad he is finally getting the recognition he deserves for his invention.

Faults found with Bush, Democrats
In spite of egregious fumbling, bumbling and bungling by a government of, by and for Republicans, Democrats cannot muster memory, spine or voice to haul their political adversaries to task.
Both parties forget hard lessons of common experience. Memories of Vietnam misadventures escape official Washington. It's unclear now whether taxing our way out of our first drug war mess -- Prohibition -- ever sunk in at all.
President Bush claims credit for a Greenspan-engineered economic rebound, ignores election abuses and denigrates scientific results that run counter to his political predispositions. He assaults our environmental heritage, and regurgitates President Carter's 1977 admonitions of the perils of U.S. petroleum dependence like it's a 21st century administration epiphany. As we stumble through a bogus war with no criteria for victory, corporate-owned media retreat. Democrats simply sulk.
As European religious faiths fade, an American religious right bites the church-state separation hand that fed and nurtured it. As the Bush administration eviscerates the U.S. Constitution, accrues debt enough to shackle multiple generations and manipulates "war powers" to elevate princely authority, corporate media smile blandly. Democrats wring their hands.
The anemic political party benignly assists the overreaching party.
Pox upon both their houses.
RICHARD P. WEST Encinitas
Our country apparently cannot pay for two wars, maintain troops and military bases in 19 countries, cut taxes for those making over $100,000 a year and at the same time fund Medicare, public education and provide low-income housing for the poor, let alone the homeless.
Our priorities have been terribly twisted. The White House has proposed a new budget which says to millions of Americans that our foreign policy is more important than they are. This is why San Diego's poor cannot access medical help, low-income housing and schools that function for them.
This is what happens when monied interests control government. It sometimes is the precursor to the next revolution.
Our democracy has been hijacked by special interests. And I have had enough.
Who will represent the average American, who seems to have been forgotten in the rush to meet the needs of Enron, Halliburton, the Pentagon, the religious right, the rich and all those who have bought influence through campaign contributions?
I once heard something about compassionate conservatism. What an oxymoron.

No such thing as a good immigrant
The San Diego Union-Tribune

Now that the Senate is taking an honest look at the immigration problem, it's time for the rest of America to be honest about what the problem really is.
Much of it really is about clashing cultures and a concern that immigrants aren't assimilating. When someone complains that San Diego is "becoming like Tijuana," or when someone else says -- as an Idaho woman recently told the Los Angeles Times -- that her neighborhood has become a Spanish-speaking "shanty town," it's a dead giveaway that, for many Americans, the problem is not with people coming into the country illegally, but with the effect they have on their surroundings once here.
This week's student walkouts, in protest of efforts to control illegal immigration, brought this sentiment to light. When more than 25,000 students in Los Angeles, and thousands of young people in other cities, took to the streets, what enraged many observers -- judging from talk radio and television shows -- was the fact that the protesters waved Mexican flags.
This reaction is no surprise. This country of immigrants has never been welcoming of new immigrants, even those who came legally.
So why don't these people save us all a lot of time and admit that they don't like immigrants and don't really care how the immigrants got here? Sure, they might come across as nativist and narrow-minded, but they wouldn't be alone.
Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., proposed a moratorium on legal immigration and a revision of the H-1B visa program aimed at high-tech workers. Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, has called for a "timeout" on immigration -- both legal and illegal. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, has said that he'd limit the number of legal immigrants to just 300,000 per year -- about a third of what it is currently -- and create a system where we'd take in only the spouses and adopted children of U.S. citizens.
Bad ideas one and all.
Most Republicans in Congress insist they're not anti-immigrant. If that's the case, the time has come to prove it by allowing higher levels of legal immigration.
It's only fair. They and their political posse have insisted all along that -- in what has become a convenient sound bite -- they aren't anti-immigrant, only anti-illegal immigration.
In fact, CNN's Lou Dobbs said exactly that on his show recently in response to viewer mail that accused him of being anti-immigrant.
Personally, I think Dobbs is pro-ratings. And the fact that ratings for his show are up since he seized on the immigration issue proves that it's not only employers that prosper thanks to illegal immigrants. The same is true of aging television commentators.
And yet, on the question of whether we should maintain or increase current levels of legal immigration, Dobbs has been uncharacteristically silent.
Not so the Senate Judiciary Committee, which this week produced a reform bill that, among other things, increases the number of visas allocated to legal immigrants.
The same is true of the competing bill proposed by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. The Frist bill would more than double the number of employment-based green cards, from 140,000 to 290,000, and make more work visas available to unskilled workers. It also would make room for more legal immigrants by exempting immediate relatives of U.S. citizens from the annual allotment of visas, and increase the limits on relative-sponsored and high-skilled immigrants.
For those who believe, as I do, that legal immigrants are one of the best things about this country, and that they bring vitality and optimism and fresh blood, these reforms are just good common sense.
But for those restrictionists who don't like immigrants, regardless of how they get here, the proposals are cause for alarm.
Among the alarmed is conservative activist and anti-immigrant opportunist Angela "Bay" Buchanan. She told CNN that the Frist bill was "worse than McCain-Kennedy," the measure that forms the basis for what the Judiciary Committee produced.
What seems to worry Buchanan is that we'd still be bringing in all these immigrants -- legal sure, but still foreigners with their different languages and their strange religions.
Funny. That's pretty much what Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts was worried about in 1905 when he called for immigration restrictions because of the effect that foreigners from countries such as Ireland were having on "the quality of our citizenship" -- people that might well have included an earlier generation of the Buchanan clan.

Hiring headache; Problems obtaining foreign worker visas leave some employers scrambling - Correction Appended

A portion of her job has become so unpredictable that Brenda Phillips probably wishes she had a crystal ball to guide her.
As human resources manager for Peregrine Semiconductor, Phillips is asked to anticipate the San Diego company's staffing needs, calculate its expansion rate and predict any business setbacks that might occur months before they do.
The combination of a thriving technology company and a shortage of qualified specialty engineers in the United States means she sometimes has to draw upon professionals from other countries to meet Peregrine's needs. Quotas limit the number of worker visas, and the cumbersome process to hire them is at once complicated, time-consuming, costly and perplexing.
And there is no certainty that her company will be successful in obtaining a visa.
"The H-1B visa will be the death of me," said Phillips, whose company makes integrated circuits for the wireless market. "I have to recruit and make offers to people a year or 18 months ahead of their effective hiring date ... and I have to take into account what might happen to the company in the interim."
The use of the H-1B visa to import high-level technology expertise from other countries is an overlooked part of the current immigration debate, lumped together as it is with the issues of low-skilled workers and those who enter the United States illegally. But increasing demand for H-1B visas may push them into the limelight.
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services grants 65,000 H-1B visas annually to foreign technical workers with bachelor's degrees. It grants an additional 20,000 H-1B visas to job applicants with advanced degrees.
The quota for the visas was hit July 26 this year for the 2007 federal fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The cap was reached two weeks earlier this year than last, a sign of the increasing demand.
The H-1B visa limit is compounded by a dearth of U.S. students pursuing math and science degrees that would prepare them for jobs in the biotech, telecom and computer industries. Businesses contend this shortage puts them at a competitive disadvantage with companies in nations with emphasis on math and science education and with nations that have less restrictive immigration policies.
"This is a critical issue for our country," said Julie Meier Wright, president and chief executive of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corp. "Companies follow a talented work force. If they can't find what they need in the U.S., they'll look elsewhere."
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the demand for science and engineering graduates will grow 24 percent from 2004 to 2014.
In 2004, more than 40 percent of master's degrees and more than 50 percent of doctoral degrees issued by U.S. colleges and universities were awarded to foreign nationals, according to the National Science Foundation.
"Unfortunately, the number of visas allowed isn't even close to meeting the demand," said Van Goodwin, an immigration attorney with Littler Mendelson in San Diego. "We are educating and training people in the U.S., then sending them back to their home countries to work. Meanwhile, we have jobs here that aren't being filled."
Some technology companies might employ only one or two H-1B visa workers, while others might employ dozens. No one seems to have an accurate handle on how many of the visas are used in the San Diego region. Most companies have been reluctant to discuss their employment of foreign workers publicly, even though it is a hot topic at industry and trade association meetings.
A letter being circulated by the AeA in San Diego to push Congress for more H-1B visas has been signed by executives at nearly three dozen companies, including Cymer, Websense, Iomega and Qualcomm.
"It's simply become more difficult for companies to depend on these visas because they are hard to get," said Joe Panetta, president and chief executive of BIOCOM, a trade group that represents 470 life science companies in Southern California.
"Our industry has always relied on H-1B visas because we don't have the trained work force here we need. Not being able to depend on them makes doing business difficult."
Rodney Moses, vice president of talent acquisition for Carlsbad-based Invitrogen, said the difficulty with obtaining visas for its needs is causing the biotech company to open operations in other countries.
Invitrogen provides tools and services to drug development companies and laboratories and has operations in 70 countries. It operates divisions in India and China that employ about 245 people. Seventy-five of its 1,200 U.S. employees hold H-1B visas.
"Our company's goal is to hire the best and brightest," Moses said. "If we can't find them here, we will have to find them someplace else. Our company standards will remain the same. We can't adjust them downward because the talent isn't available in the U.S."
The most recent figures from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shows that there were 217,340 people working in the United States under H-1B visas in 2003, or about 3.6 percent of the nation's 6 million technology workers.
To obtain an H-1B visa, companies must first convince the federal government that they cannot find qualified workers in the United States. They also must pay about $2,200 in fees to the government, plus attorney's expenses in the range of $1,000 to $2,500 for each applicant.
Pressure by U.S. companies and a strong economy caused Congress to raise the cap on H-1B visas as high as 195,000 earlier this decade, although that annual limit was never reached. The cap was reset at 65,000 in 2004, where it remains today. The 20,000 visas for advanced degrees was enacted in 2005.
H-1B visa holders are granted temporary work permits, issued for three-year periods and renewable once. They can work for U.S. companies up to six years before they have to return home or obtain permanent residency in the United States.
San Diego immigration attorney Jeanne Malitz says obtaining a visa for a foreign employee can be daunting.
"It's very time-consuming and is a frustrating process," she said. "Companies are faced with finding people well in advance of when they can put them on the payroll, then they have to sponsor the individual for a visa. But even if they find the perfect person for a job, they may be out of luck because there are no available visas."
Malitz, who has worked with 200 companies on visa issues over the past 17 years, said the common notion that some U.S. employers hire foreign workers because they can pay them less is misguided.
"I'm sure it has happened, but it just doesn't happen very often," she said. "I think employers simply turn to hiring foreign workers when they can't find Americans with those skills. For all the effort and cost involved, I don't think they would save much by hiring foreign workers."
Kevin Carroll, executive director of the AeA's San Diego council, says that companies use H-1B visas because their work demands it.
"The myth of H-1B visa holders taking American jobs is preposterous on its surface," he said. "The unemployment rate of electrical engineers is an astoundingly low 1.5 percent. Clearly, the need is outstripping the demand for high-tech workers. And the quickest way to kill high-tech in San Diego is by cutting off the supply of workers."
For the federal fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, H-1B visa applications are accepted beginning the previous April 1. This year, all available visas were allotted by July 26. Last year, visa allotments were completed by Aug. 10.
"The date just keeps getting earlier and earlier because of the demand," Goodwin said. "If you want to hire someone on one of these visas, you'd better be ready to file your application on April 1."
That process gives HR managers like Phillips fits.
"I have to start looking for people many months before we can put them on the payroll," said Phillips of Peregrine Semiconductor. "I have to get them through the interview process, make an offer and have it accepted before I can start the application process. And I have to get the application in five or six months before these people can even work for us.
"It makes it very difficult on us. You never know when you're going to have a job you can't fill with an American worker. We've had phenomenal growth in our company, but who can predict that and what it will mean in terms of hiring more workers? Most companies can go out and hire the people they need in 30 or 60 days. But we're faced with recruiting people a year before we can put them on the payroll. A lot of things can happen to a business in that time."
If the H-1B visa is daunting for employers, it is just as troublesome for employees.
Anna Li, a test engineer for Peregrine Semiconductor, has been working in the United States for five years under an H-1B visa. Li is a native of China who obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering there and then immigrated to Singapore.
She first worked for Oni Systems in San Jose, which wound up merging with a second company and eliminating her job. She then worked for Peregrine Semiconductor before she was laid off, then for one other company briefly before being rehired by Peregrine Semiconductor.
"Each time I go to work for a new company, I have to reapply for the H-1B," she said. "It's frustrating because it takes so long and is so hard. It takes time to complete the paperwork and then you just have to wait."
Li, one of four H-1B visa holders working at the San Diego company, said her visa will expire next April. Two years ago, she applied for nonresident (green card) status that would allow her to work in the United States indefinitely.
"I know many people in similar situations holding master's or Ph.D.s," she said. "We put out an effort that helps these companies, but the government has made it very hard for us to stay in U.S. I just don't think it should be so painful to work here."
Some foreign-born students in U.S. universities can bide time after graduation by seeking special training visas that allow them to work in the United States for up to a year.
Yet, Michael Hindi, director of international students and scholars at the University of California San Diego, said few students at his school take advantage of those visas, nor do they try to get hired under the visa program.
"At least 80 percent want to go back home," he said. "They may not go back to their own country since they have specialized skills, but they will go back to a country near their home."
The situation is quite different at San Diego State University, said Jane Kalionzes, associate director of the International Student Center.
"We have a large number of our international students in computer science and electrical engineering who stay and go to work," she said.
U.S. Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., thinks that the need for highly educated professional workers from other countries has been lost in the greater immigration debate. That's why in June he introduced his own bill that would loosen hiring restrictions for U.S. companies.
"The long-term solution is to produce students that have the math and science backgrounds American business needs," he said. "But if we don't have that talent here, can we expect American business not to go to other countries to get it?"
Shadegg's bill, known as the SKIL Act, proposes raising the H-1B visa cap to 115,000 visas per year, with the potential for increases in the year ahead.

An Aug. 27 story incorrectly reported that there were 217,340 people working in the United States under the H-1B visa program in 2003. That number is the total of H-1B visa permits issued that year for people working in highly skilled technology jobs, education and specialty occupations. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it does not have a comprehensive figure for all people working in the country under H-1B visas during that period.
The story also incorrectly reported the number of master's and doctoral degrees earned by foreign students in 2004. In the fields of math, computer science and engineering, more than 40 percent of all the master's degrees and more than 50 percent of all the doctoral degrees were awarded to foreign students.

Ease work-visa rules, venture capitalists say, pointing to . . . Firms' foreign-born founders

Injecting itself into a national debate on immigration, the venture capital industry reports that foreign-born entrepreneurs were crucial to the success of Intel, Google and scores of other U.S. technology companies.
In a study to be released today, the National Venture Capital Association found that over the past 15 years, immigrants founded one of every four venture-backed startups that became publicly traded companies.
By releasing the study now, NVCA officials said they hoped to seize a post-election opportunity to ease restrictions on employment visas that enable foreign engineers and scientists to work and study in the United States.
Given the increased rancor of the immigration debate, "we decided we needed really hard data to make our case, and so we commissioned the study," said Mark Heesen,president of the Virginia-based trade group.
The group called the 39-page report the first attempt to quantify the success stories of people such as Andy Grove, the Hungarian-born engineer who founded Intel, and Russian-born Sergey Brin, who helped start Google.
Immigrant-founded public companies today employ about 220,000 people in the United States alone, and represent a total market value of more than $500 billion, according to the study.
"Yahoo would not be an American company today if the United States had not welcomed my family and me almost 30 years ago," said Jerry Yang, who was born in Taiwan and co-founded Yahoo. "We must do all that we can to ensure that the door is open for the next generation of top entrepreneurs, engineers and scientists from around the world to come to the U.S. and thrive."
About 62 percent of immigrant-founded public companies were based in California, most likely because of the regional clusters formed by venture capital firms and technology companies.
Massachusetts ranked second, with 14 percent, followed by New Jersey, with 6 percent. Washington state and Texas each had 3 percent, with the remaining 12 percent located in other states.
In San Diego, the list of immigrant-founded startups includes Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Novatel Wireless, Arena Pharmaceuticals and Wireless Facilities.
The NVCA also said two-thirds of the U.S. companies that rely on H-1B visas to hire foreign workers agreed that "current U.S. immigration laws affecting skilled professionals harm American competitiveness."
H-1B refers to a section in the Immigration and Nationality Act that enables U.S. companies and universities to employ educated foreign workers with specialized skills in engineering, mathematics, business and other fields.
By the nature of their journey, people who immigrate to the United States are more driven and more willing to take risks, said Anadys founder Kleanthis Xanthopoulos,who was born in Greece.
"It's an extremely short-sighted view to limit H-1B visas," Xanthopoulos said.
Since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the number of H-1B visas granted to U.S. employers has dropped to 65,000 a year, from 195,000 annually in 2000 and 2001.
Under a so-called skill bill, introduced by Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, the cap on H-1B visas would be raised to 115,000 a year -- and would exempt nearly 260,000 foreign students enrolled in U.S. graduate programs. The NVCA backs the measure, along with technology groups such as the Semiconductor Industry Association and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
Proponents distinguished their efforts, however, from the broader U.S. debate over immigration.
"Skilled immigrants are huge multipliers for the U.S. economy, as the study has shown," said Vinit Nijhawan, an Indian-born entrepreneur who is a partner at Key Venture Partners, a venture capital firm in Waltham, Mass.
The broader debate, Nijhawan said, has mainly been about unskilled labor and the burdens imposed on U.S. health care and social services by illegal immigrants. But, he added, "the skilled labor debate really has to rise up in priority because it is extremely important for the future of the U.S."
Although finding solutions to illegal immigration and the H-1B visas are not mutually exclusive, proponents suggested the H-1B issue might be a simpler problem for Congress to address.
"It's very worthy of serious debate in these final days of the 109th Congress," said the NVCA's Heesen. "So we're looking very closely at this lame-duck session, and hopefully something can be done in this period. If not, we'll certainly be back in the 110th Congress."
The study was co-written by Stuart Anderson, the executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, and Michaela Platzer, the president of Content First, a research group.
From 1990 to 2005, they found that 88 of 268 venture-funded public companies were founded by immigrants, or 25 percent. From 1970 to 2005, the percentage was almost 20 percent, with 144 of 725 venture-funded public companies started by immigrants.
In a glimpse of the future, the NVCA also reported that a survey found that immigrants founded almost 47 percent of existing venture-backed companies that remain privately held.
In other results, the study found the highest number of immigrant entrepreneurs were from India. Of the 144 ventures, 32 were founded or co-founded by immigrants from India; 17 were from Israel; and 16 from Taiwan. None was from Mexico, and only three were from Latin America or South America, Anderson said.
Slightly more than 90 percent of the 144 companies fell into four general categories: 60 were high-tech manufacturers, 34 were information technology companies, 30 were focused on life sciences, and 6 provided professional, scientific or technical services.

Help U.S. compete; Emphasis on immigrants' job skills is crucial

Compromise measures hammered out after months of back and forth are often timid and unsatisfying. But in one crucial area, the massive immigration reform bill that emerged this week is bracingly smart and bold. It requires that merit be elevated over connections and family ties in evaluating visa applicants, and increases from 65,000 to 115,000 the annual number of H-1B temporary visas for workers with highly needed job skills. In so doing, the bill acknowledges that the United States is in a global economic competition that will never go away -- and that our immigration policy must help our ability to compete.
Demagogues such as Lou Dobbs and Pat Buchanan may pretend globalization can be reversed, but it is inexorable. And while it produces broad anxiety among the U.S. work force, this anxiety isn't rooted in any economic upheaval. The U.S. economy is thriving -- precisely because it is so adept at international competition. This year, the companies that make up the S&P 500 are expected to have more foreign sales than U.S. sales for the first time.
But much of the world is doing all it can to catch up -- not just China and India. New Zealand and much of Europe are cutting corporate tax rates, and nations everywhere hunt for workers with information-technology skills.
Against this backdrop, the need to favor immigrants with job skills and English proficiency -- while limiting family reunification preferences to spouses and minor children -- is strikingly obvious.
Yet critics -- often Latinos who like the fact that Latinos dominate both legal and illegal immigration -- choose to pretend otherwise. In immigration, "the landscaper is just as important as the computer scientist," said Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, D-Ill. That may be a noble, earnest sentiment. But when we're talking about the needs of the U.S. economy, it is absurd.

Immigrant skills; Employers are better judge than bureaucrats

The immigration debate is about more than just controlling illegal immigration. It's also about being much smarter and more creative in deciding who will be allowed to come into this country legally.
Congress is considering putting less emphasis on family reunification and more emphasis on a point system that would reward immigrants' skills and education. So far, so good. This isn't anti-family, as some on the left claim. It's common sense. There's nothing wrong with giving a preference to the spouse or children of a U.S. citizen or legal resident. But that principle need not extend as it has for decades to every adult relative in the family. Besides, generally speaking, we like the idea of an immigration system that looks favorably upon the educated and skilled, especially if we're talking about individuals who are already here working or attending U.S. universities on temporary visas. Why should they be forced to go home when we've made a substantial investment in them?
Having said that, the real question is where we go from there. If the only criteria considered are education and skills, and we do not take into account the specific needs of the market, you could easily wind up with a system that puts supply above demand. That's backward. You'd have a government bureaucracy that lets in scores of engineers, doctors and PhDs regardless of whether there are jobs available in those fields. That's a recipe for one thing: a legion of very well-educated taxi drivers and short-order cooks.
Employers should make these decisions by sponsoring the individuals they want to hire. Employers even have a tool at their disposal: The H-1B visa program, which is designed to import high-skilled workers. It should be expanded.
So let's fix the problems with the current system, absolutely. But let's not create another problem in its place. Leave the discretion where it belongs -- with employers, and not with government.

Finding greener pastures at home, Asian scientists leaving America - Correction Appended

Changyou Chen grew up in the Chinese countryside, the son of farmers, dreaming of studying science at a big-city university.
Once he made it to Beijing, where he studied molecular biology and virology at China's prestigious Peking Union Medical College, Chen and his dreams turned to the United States, which he considered the premier place to earn an advanced science degree.
His government thought so, too.
In the mid-1980s, Chen was granted a passport so he could complete his undergraduate work at the University of Colorado. He was part of a massive wave of foreign students enrolling in U.S. universities, where some of Asia's best and brightest earned advanced technical degrees.
For years, these highly motivated foreign nationals stayed in the United States, working in high-tech industries and helping America remain a global leader.
But that has started to change.
Frustrated by stagnating federal funding for research and clampdowns on visas, Asian scientists are increasingly returning to their homelands. One-quarter of the 700,000 students who left China between 1978 and 2003 have gone back, China's Ministry of Education has reported.
Most of those left the United States recently, with more than 20,000 a year returning to China in the past five years, according to the ministry.
In countries with blossoming economies, such as China, South Korea, India and Singapore, governments have identified biotechnology and other high-tech industries as a way to expand beyond basic manufacturing. They are spending billions to underwrite companies, build high-tech parks and help startup businesses cut through red tape.
The trend has negative implications in the United States, which has already lost much of its high-tech manufacturing to outsourcing, said Greg Lucier, chief executive of Carlsbad-based biotechnology company Invitrogen. If foreign scientists continue to leave, the United States also could lose its lead in innovation.
"In the U.S., innovation is still our strong suit. But if we are not going to fund basic research so that we can have the infrastructure for great research and development in the private sector, we are mortgaging the future of this country," said Lucier, who also is chairman of Biocom, the biotechnology trade group for Southern California.
Chen was supposed to return home two decades ago, but the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising and government crackdown convinced him and his wife, Zhu Shen, who also works in biotechnology, that the time was not right.
But in 2004, Chen decided to start looking for a job because his employer, San Diego-based Targeted Molecules, was getting low on cash.
A friend who was running the Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health in Southern China recruited Chen to run the government-funded institute's antibody program, a prestigious post Chen doubted he could match in the United States.
Part of his thinking, he said, was that China has changed a lot since Tiananmen Square. Entrepreneurialism is again embraced. Biomedical research has been recognized as a priority for the country, where many people outside large cities lack access to health care. And China is becoming a global player in the industry.
"In China, I could get a better position because the Chinese respect what you learn in the U.S.," Chen said. "Also, China is willing to provide you with a lot of initial resources, like grant money or a starting fund, so you can hire people and pick your projects.
"In China, there's a feeling of opportunity to hit it big."
At the same time, Chen's wife was offered a position as head of business development for Immusol, a tiny, privately held biotechnology company in San Diego. After much thought, the couple decided to live apart on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean and hope they will reap economic and professional rewards in a few years.
The same economic draw for returnees is happening in India.
An advertisement posted recently on an online job bank offered by Sabinsa Corp., a biotechnology company in Bangalore, India, sought someone to head its proteomics initiative, which studies the structure and ever-changing functions of proteins that play a central role in the life of an organism. The position paid $100,000 annually, plus free housing and a car.
That salary in India would allow someone to easily afford a chauffeur, a maid and child care, said Deb Chakravarti, head of the proteomics program at the Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences in Claremont.
India's economy is very strong, Chakravarti said. Money that 35 years ago was being spent on the military and agriculture is now available for other areas of India's economy, he said.
Government research funding is unlimited right now, Chakravarti said. Recruitment out of India is aggressive, and biotechnology is booming.
"Whenever someone goes home, they are asked to interview at several places," Chakravarti said.
While talented scientists are attracted by plentiful funding in Asia, unreliable financing in the United States is driving them away.
Funding for the National Institutes of Health, which employs thousands of research scientists and distributes grant money nationwide to finance 34 percent of all U.S. biomedical research, has become a year-to-year proposition debated by Congress.
Between 1996 and 2003, Congress more than doubled NIH funding from about $11 billion to more than $25 billion. But since then, budgeted increases have fallen short of inflation, even as new research areas were identified to deal with bioterrorism after 2001.
Meanwhile, the rate of grant applications being approved by the NIH has dropped to about one in 10. After spending years earning advanced degrees, principal scientists find themselves waiting until they are 42 years old, on average, before they receive their first NIH grant.
U.S. companies bemoan the loss of workers who are now making competitors stronger. In the life-sciences industry, the trend is expected to continue unless the U.S. government begins to look at the funding of scientific discovery as part of a long-term economic strategy, said Jon Retzlaff, director of Legislative Relations for the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.
Scientists in the trenches agree.
"One reason this country has been so strong for so many years is because of our advances in research, particularly health and life sciences, where we were so far ahead of everyone else," said Shu Chien, a bioengineering professor at the University of California San Diego and member of all three U.S. national science academies.
"Somehow our leadership in the government has lost sight of that," Chien said.
As head of medicinal chemistry for Roche Pharmaceuticals in China, Yun He, a U.S.-educated returnee, has seen firsthand what the Chinese government is investing in life sciences. Professors receive large research grants and are given funds and other perks to recruit more academics to return home.
He said the quality of research in China has been steadily improving, as evidenced by the increasing number of high-impact scientific journal publications coming out of the country.
After spending 16 years in the United States, earning his Ph.D. at Scripps Research institute in La Jolla and working at Isis, a Carlsbad-based biotechnology company, and the Genomics Institute of Novartis Research Foundation in La Jolla, He decided to become part of the entrepreneurial excitement in China. As a bonus, he is able to live in Shanghai, where he has relatives.
It is not just Asians who are leaving. Problems in obtaining funding have led some top U.S. scientists to jump at Asia's inducements.
Neal Copeland and Nancy Jenkins, a husband-and-wife team who were the top scientists at the NIH's National Cancer Institute, quit after 22 years and took jobs in Singapore.
Besides offering state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, the Singapore government has committed at least five years of funding to the research program at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, which Copeland and Jenkins were asked to join.
"Now we are working in our dream lab," Copeland said. "We're going to stay here till they kick us out, or we retire."
Further frustrating the scientific community are limits on work visas for foreigners.
Temporary visas for immigrants with special skills, known as H1B visas, are limited to 65,000 a year, plus 20,000 visas for immigrants who earn advanced academic degrees in the United States. For the ninth year, the cap on applications for H1B visas was hit on the first day they were available for fiscal year 2008.
There is also an annual cap of 120,000 on the number of permanent residency green cards awarded each year.
A study published in August by the Kauffman Foundation of Kansas City, Mo., found a backlog of 1.1 million highly skilled immigrants and their family members waiting for green cards in 2006.
That has a dramatic impact on high-tech industries in the United States, said Vivek Wadhwa, a Harvard fellow who was the principal author of the study.
One-fourth of all patents filed in the United States are filed by foreigners, Wadhwa said.
"Those are the people we are sending back home, where they will compete with us," he said.
Returnees are coveted employees because they bring with them the experience of working in U.S. industry.
Yu Liang Huang has the experience on both sides of the Pacific that Chinese companies wanted and U.S. companies are just now growing to appreciate. After pursuing postdoctoral work at Ohio State University, he worked for several years as a consultant to British and U.S. biotechnology companies trying to do business in China and, later, at the now-defunct San Diego bioprocessing company Egen.
But when Huang decided to start his own bioprocessing company, Generon, he did it in his native China.
The company licenses early-stage compounds out of U.S. companies or research institutes or forms strategic partnerships that allow the clinical development of the drug in China. The goal is to complete early clinical testing and then bring the drug back to the lucrative U.S. market.
Labor costs in China are cheaper than in the United States, and the local and central governments of China offer monetary support, help making necessary business connections and assistance in securing licenses and other needed approvals, Huang said.
"It is hard to get to this level in the United States," the 45-year-old CEO said. "So right now we have to enjoy that advantage provided by China, and maybe later we can return to the U.S."
Correction


A story in Sunday's paper about foreign scientists leaving the United States reported incorrectly that this was the ninth straight year in which a cap on H1B visas for immigrants with special skills was reached on the first day the visas were available. This was the first time the cap of 65,000 visas was reached on the first day, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and an additional 20,000 visas for immigrants with advanced degrees from U.S. institutions were not claimed for several weeks.

Paul E. Jacobs took over as chief executive officer of Qualcomm Inc. on July 1, 2005, succeeding his father, Irwin Jacobs, a co-founder of the company. Paul Jacobs received a bachelor's, master's and doctorate in electrical engineering from the University of California Berkeley and personally holds more than 25 patents for inventions in wireless technology. He has been the corporate driver behind Qualcomm's efforts to remake the cell phone into a device not just for voice communications, but also for personal entertainment, computing and information access. Jacobs and Qualcomm President Steven Altman were interviewed by Union-Tribune editors and a reporter on April 29. Following are excerpts of Jacobs' remarks.
In your industry in general, and your company in particular, is consumer demand driving the technology or are your products driving consumer demand?
It's changed over time. It used to be we'd have a sense of what we thought was going to be interesting. Like we were advertising the Internet on your phone back in 1998. We were a little ahead of the time. It caught on slowly. It's like almost any technology -- it's a little slow and then all of a sudden it seems to happen overnight.
We started out that way where the engineers in the lab would say, "Oh, I've got this great idea. I know how to get more bandwidth over the air" or some other performance metric. "I can get more calls" in a given area or something. And then we'd say, "OK, now what do we do with that?" And obviously the Internet -- because we were all Internet guys from very early on -- was something that we thought was going to be important on the phone. But, like I said, it's taken a long time.
But now I contrast that to today, where we just launched our mobile TV service, MediaFLO, with technology that actually started from the other side. I had some friends that had sold a chain of radio stations. And it just struck me -- man, there's a lot of money in radio stations and the reason why they're so valuable is because you have all these platforms to receive them. Well, we can build that technology into a phone. And people said, "Oh, is the screen going to be good enough?" We looked at the screen and said, "Ah, the screen looks good. People are going to like this thing." So it actually started out with an idea for what the market was and where there was an opportunity and then we developed the technology from that and said, "OK, you need to make sure that you have a good battery life, that you can channel surf and switch the channels fast" and stuff like that. So it's actually really been a big change.
And the other thing that's going on is that we've gotten to the point where, in terms of computing power in the chip that goes into your cell phone, we've pretty much used all the tricks that people know of in digital communications. So now when you look at a new generation of technology, radio technology, and you compare it in efficiency, it's essentially no more efficient. So now you have to actually understand the application and you have to understand how the network is rolled out and all these other things so when we look at making new radios it's no longer that a guy in the lab can say, "Hey, I know how to make this be 10 times more efficient." It's really the case that they say, "Under this application, this circumstance, I can do this trick and things will work better because of that." So it's fundamentally shifted the way the industry works.
All the analysts I've seen say that MediaFLO is a great product and that it really does work well but they're questioning whether people really want to spend an hour watching something on a 2-inch screen.
It's amazing. There are so many misconceptions that you have about TV on your phone. Everybody said you'd only watch three minutes at a time and you wouldn't want to watch the screen and advertising would be really intrusive. They all turned out not to be true.
AT&T is launching a Sony Pictures channel, which is all full-length movies. And the reason is because we actually found out that people will sit there and watch a movie on their phone and the anecdote is in one of the studies we did, an interview, and the guy said, "My wife was sleeping and I didn't want to turn the TV on, so I just sat there and watched it on the phone." The quality's good enough.
Is there a generational component to all this? Are younger people much faster to start using this technology?
I think that's true. It generally is the case with younger people adopting all of these sooner. But if you look at TV usage, it is much higher in the older demographic and so we made sure that we had content that would be interesting to people -- news content and financial, things like that that would be more interesting. With our target market we skewed it fairly young, below 35. But I don't think in the end it's going to be that related to age.
Right now it looks like we just took cable TV and put it on the phone. The underlying system has a lot more capability to it. We're working on the software to enable it but one of the things that we think is going to be interesting is that when you are advertising over the air, along with the advertisement we'll send coupons along.
We just had an announcement with Citi, so we have four of the top five banks already signed up to work with us on a banking application on the phone. And the notion is that the advertisement would come down with a coupon. And the advertising can all be targeted. You go to the store and you use that phone to pay and it's going to actually track the transaction all the way back to the coupon so the advertiser now knows that they didn't just buy an eyeball, they actually got a transaction out of it. We think that's going to raise the value for the consumer and for the advertisers.
How close is that type of banking application?
In Asia they're doing it already. Here I think it'll be slower and I would argue that it's probably going to be generational. But we have an investment in a company called Obopay, which did something that was interesting. They took the phone and they tied it to a debit card. You can transfer money with the phone. Say your kid goes to the mall and wants to buy a soda and you want to send them $5 so you transfer it to their phone. The phone's associated with the card. They actually pay with the card and then it debits that way. I think people would adopt that fairly quickly and so we're actually working with the credit card companies to manage transfers.
We've had stories about how hiring is one of your more difficult obstacles in San Diego. Is that because the work force is not available in San Diego?
We still are hiring a ton in San Diego and we actually attract people from other parts of the country to come here. Real estate prices are a little bit of a shocker for people when they come here. Generally the jobs are fairly high-paying because they're engineering or business. We're not doing manufacturing here anymore so people can tend to afford it. One of the biggest issues that we're running into though is the H-1B visa. It's actually a scary thing for the United States because we're bringing a lot of people, the best and the brightest in the world, to American universities to train. And then we can't keep them here. We send them back to their home country. And what's now happening is that we've created enough critical masses of people, well-trained people, in those countries that there's innovation happening there that used to happen here. So the venture capital monies going there now, too, so it's very scary for the United States.
What should the policy be?
I think if you come to an American university and you get a degree from an American university we should welcome you as a citizen because you're going to generate a lot more than you take in services.
What else should we know about your company?
When you ask will we stay in San Diego, you know, Irwin definitely made the company be about people, and not just the people in the company but also the community. In fact, the business model is about partnering. It really is a company where we've looked at how do we actually fit into a broader equity system, whether it's the local community or the world or the industry. Obviously, one of the big areas that we're focused on is education. We put $70 million into education locally.
In what form?
A lot of different things, all the way up to UCSD, for a leading-edge technology, all the way down to doing things where we'll take some high school students into universities for math and science training, to giving scholarships, to actually providing training programs for K-12. We're very focused on that because we're worried that that's not getting done very well anymore. And obviously with all the pressure on state budgets and so forth we think it's important for us to step up on the education side. And it's not OK for us to complain about it without trying to do something about it.
Has anybody representing the Chargers approached you for help with a new stadium?
We were trying to do a bunch of things at one point to see whether we could help out in the process and structure some kind of a deal and even looking at whether it was possible to bring an arena and stuff like that. I tell you, the local situation is a little messed up right now and hopefully that gets clarified over time so that we can move ahead.
We want to see the Chargers stay in town. Any way that we can help try and improve the environment here is good for the city and it's good for us to attract people to San Diego. We're not a consumer brand anymore. When we did the Qualcomm Stadium naming it was because we had a handset business back then and we had the World Series and the Super Bowl within the first year so that was incredibly good for us. We don't actually spend that much money on consumer branding anymore. You probably noticed that we don't do a lot of advertising because we just made the decision that it's better to work behind the scenes and let our partners' brands be the ones that are out there. But now we've got something like MediaFLO and there will be some brand-building about MediaFLO. We'd love to see the situation get a little bit cleared up and whether there's something that can happen but right now, to be honest, you know it's very, very low level right now because we just ran into so many roadblocks we couldn't figure out how to get something done.

Qualcomm's bright outlook; San Diego tech firm poised to dominate massive new market
The San Diego Union-Tribune

Qualcomm's remarkable success story is entering a new chapter, and The New York Times has taken notice. Last week, the Times carried a lengthy account suggesting the San Diego wireless
technology firm just might be on track to supplant mighty Intel as the king of computer chip makers. The article noted that Qualcomm's new generation of chips are so much faster and cheaper than Intel's that the company could dominate the massive, emerging market for MIDs -- mobile Internet devices -- that offer some or all of the attributes of both cell phones and personal computers.
Qualcomm, which last year became the world's largest supplier of cell phone chips, is in a prime position. This is wonderful news for San Diego, which has benefited immensely from the company's explosive growth over the past 23 years.
There is one worry on the horizon, however. As Qualcomm Chief Executive Paul Jacobs pointed out in a recent interview with the Union-Tribune, federal immigration policies that cap the number of H-1B visas for foreign scientists and engineers don't just hinder U.S. tech firms; they funnel talented people to other countries, resulting in "innovation happening there that used to happen here," which attracts venture capital funding.
Jacobs calls this "very scary for the United States." He's absolutely right. The need to reform our H-1B visa policies grows more urgent by the day.

More of what we need; Visas for highly skilled workers lag demand
The San Diego Union-Tribune

Legal immigrants who play by the rules to get to the United States often find it difficult to stay here.
People from around the world come to study in U.S. universities on temporary visas. They often excel in their studies and earn their degrees with ease. After graduation, many of them beat a path back to their home countries to help improve the lives of the people who live there. There's nothing wrong with that. What's wrong is that, for those who want to find a legal way to remain in the United States and earn a living here, the deck is stacked against them. Just when these individuals are about to enter their high-productivity years -- when they generate income, consume goods and pay taxes -- the United States ships them home.
According to a recent article in USA Today, only about 65,000 H-1B visas are granted to allow high-skilled foreigners to come legally each year. Not only is that number pathetically low, considering the demand, but the quota is also filled on a first-come, first-served basis without so much as a nod to what jobs need to be filled. Those who oppose increasing the cap on visas for foreign professionals often do so in the name of preserving well-paying jobs for American workers.
That makes no sense. These jobs may be on U.S. soil, but they are not an entitlement for U.S. workers. In the international marketplace, American workers have to compete for jobs with the international community.
As the article points out, employers in the United States have been saying this for some time. High-tech companies have been pleading with Congress for many years to raise the number of H-1Bs to meet increased demand. That cause has been taken up by Microsoft co-founder, Bill Gates, who has made many trips to Washington to ask lawmakers to let in more software engineers.
Closer to home, the issue is on the mind of Paul Jacobs, CEO of Qualcomm. In a recent meeting with the Union-Tribune editorial board, Jacobs suggested that, aside from raising the cap on H1B visas, the U.S. government -- as an additional enticement to get highly skilled foreigners to stay -- could also speed up the process for some these individuals to become U.S. citizens. It's a great idea. Local members of Congress should take it up.
Globalization is a fact of life for the United States. So is the idea of competition. If we don't find new ways to update the current immigration system, we can expect to keep up this foolish trend of losing the most-highly skilled immigrants in the world to other countries. And if that happens, we stand to lose much more than that in the years to come.

A party-line vote
Thank you for reporting how our local congressional delegation voted in “House OKs extending billions in tax breaks” (Dec. 10). I have never seen a clearer case of each party’s priorities. Democratic Reps. Susan Davis and Bob Filner voted “yes” for a deduction of up to $4,000 for college tuition, and a deduction of up to $250 for teachers who spend their own money for books and other classroom supplies. Republican Reps. Brian Bilbray, Darrell Issa and Duncan Hunter voted “no.” The deductions would be funded by a tax increase on investment fund managers, like hedge funds. When it came down to a choice between Wall Street and Main Street, the Democrats supported parents, teachers and students, while the Republicans put their priorities with Wall Street investment firms.
ROBERT TORMEY
EscondidoAll in a name
Supervisor Greg Cox’s commentary Dec. 10 about tools needed in the graffiti battles reminds me of my late partner Terry Shelman’s idea that the very words we use need changing. He thought that graffiti was too celebratory, suggesting confetti, and the name should reflect its true impact, grafilthy.
TERRY BRAZELL
San DiegoAn outstanding teen
In response to “Girl, 16, devoted to making dying wish come true” (Dec. 13):
What a heartwarming article. I am certain that the parents of Caitlin Crummett of Orange County must be very proud of her. I don’t know any teenagers who would be so willing to give of their time and themselves to help someone who is at the end of their life. We hear so many negative things about the teenagers of today – it was wonderful to see that there are some truly wonderful ones in our own community. I would love to contribute to this wonderful project!
PENNY CLAESSON
San DiegoTest score gains
Regarding “Accountability testing” (Dec. 13) and “S.D. pupils post gains on federal math tests” (Dec. 9):
I was in the eighth grade last year in the San Diego Unified School District and I am proud to be a member of the class that boosted test scores for the city. However, there was a mistake in the articles. The test results were from last year’s eighth-graders, making it the class of 2013, not 2014, as the articles stated, that deserves the credit. My peers and I worked hard and I think that we, the class of 2013, are owed proper recognition.
GABRIELLE MAGINN
San Diego
I am curious about the increased emphasis and use of resources toward test scores in math. What is the cost to other areas of learning? I wonder if anyone at San Diego Unified has taken the time to calculate what areas of learning are hurt by this focus, or are they too busy beaming? Educators need to remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character is the purpose of education. I hope test scores in a few subjects are not the only thing we hold up as success in education.
ZACK DYL
San DiegoStore cards (cont’d)
Regarding the Dec. 12 letter from Melody Fleetwood, “Big Brother watching with store club cards”:
The stores can’t deny you the discount even if you aren’t “on record” with them; that’s illegal. At a store rarely visited, just ask for the “manager’s card/code” to key in the discounts. (If the checker is clueless, get the actual manager.)
At my “usual” stores, I just give them bogus data. I’ve done so for many years with no problems.
JIM GABRISCH
San DiegoConvert to metric
In David Brooks’ column (“Enough with the malaise, already,” Dec. 11), he lists nine ways the government might assist in achieving a bipartisan innovation agenda. I would like to add a 10th: The government should use some of the remaining stimulus funds to convert the United States fully to the metric system, and so enable us to catch up with the rest of the world.
Sixth on Brooks’ list is to “loosen the so-called H-1B visa quota to attract skilled immigrants.” However, these “skilled immigrants” would all come from countries that already are on the metric system, such as China, India, Japan, South Korea and all the European countries. The children in these countries don’t have to wait until they are in science courses to learn about the metric system; it is part of their daily life.
If the United States undertook to make the conversion, the stimulus to the economy and science education would be terrific.

Land of immigrants; U.S. needs more legal foreign workers, not fewer

One would expect former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney to have a thoughtful approach to the immigration issue. Both his father, George Romney, and his grandfather, Gaskell Romney, were born in Mexico. His great-grandfather, Miles Park Romney, fled the United States and crossed the southern border in 1884 to escape religious persecution. The result was the Mormon enclave of Colonia Juarez in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. So this family knows what it’s like to have to leave your country behind and gamble on the promise of brighter days down the road.
Romney hit the right notes during a recent radio interview when he claimed that U.S. immigration policy isn’t just broken, but upside down. We have plenty of illegal immigrants doing low-skilled work, he said. And yet we make it hard for people who come to the United States legally to study or work to remain here and become productive members of society.
So true. People from around the world come to study in U.S. universities on temporary visas. They often excel in class and earn their degrees with ease. But after graduation, many of them beat a path back to their home countries instead of settling in the United States. Just when these people enter their high-productivity years – when they generate income, consume goods and pay taxes – we send them home. It doesn’t make any sense.
We’ve heard this same complaint for years from the CEO’s of high-tech companies – including San Diego’s own Paul Jacobs, chairman and CEO of Qualcomm – who have pleaded with Congress to increase the annual allotment of H-1B visas for high-skilled workers. Currently, only about 65,000 H-1B visas are granted each year.
That number is shamefully low for a country of 300 million people. And that’s just to get here. Staying here is another ordeal. Some CEO’s say that, when an international student graduates from a four-year institution or graduate program, he or she should get a green card stapled to the diploma.
That’s a great idea. Aren’t these exactly the kind of people we should be trying to attract to our shores and retain once they get here? At the very least, Congress should make it easier for legal immigrants to become U.S. citizens.
If this sounds like common sense, we’re glad. It doesn’t to everyone. Believe it or not, there is – in this land of immigrants – a well-organized lobby working to keep legal immigrants out of the country right along with the illegal variety. The activists fighting that battle talk about economic competition, overcrowding, even environmental impact. Often times, what they’re really concerned about is changing demographics and cultural friction.
This is wasted energy. In our eagerness to rid the country of illegal immigration, we must not make the mistake of also getting rid of one of our most valuable imports and greatest hopes for economic prosperity: legal immigrants.

CHANGING VISA RULES TO BOOST JOB GROWTH

The fight in Congress over comprehensive immigration reform sometimes feels intractable. Democrats are nominally for big changes. Yet in 2009-10, when Democrats controlled the House, the Senate and the White House, sweeping changes didn’t advance for reasons that still aren’t fully clear.
Meanwhile, Republicans are nominally strongly against illegal immigrants. Yet some of their key allies, starting with the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, like the cheap labor provided by these immigrants.
Thankfully, the Obama administration has figured out a way to make significant changes in a key area of immigration without needing to get congressional blessings. Last week, the administration unveiled a plan to change visa policies to make it much easier to attract “foreign entrepreneurial talent of exceptional ability.”
In a telephone interview with editorial writers and other journalists from around the world, Alejandro Mayorkas, chief of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the Obama administration saw making temporary work visas and green cards more available to proven job-creators as a smart way to help the U.S. economy. The changes will allow some foreign entrepreneurs to receive H-1B visas – given to foreign workers with specialized skills – if they can demonstrate a viable plan for a start-up business that makes products or provides services that are in the U.S. national interest. Previously, these individuals had to have a standing job offer. Also, a foreign investor can receive a green card if he or she invests a minimum of $500,000 in a U.S. venture that creates at least 10 jobs.
Beyond these changes, Mayorkas also said efforts will be made to sharply streamline the processing of H-1B visa applications, which The Washington Post reported now takes up to a year in some categories. The new goal is to have processing finished within a few weeks.
This is the sort of constructive change that high-tech executives, from Bill Gates on down, have sought for years. A San Diego high-tech giant, Qualcomm, hailed the move. “We see this as a vital component of our economic recovery,” Bill Bold, company senior vice president of government affairs, told us in an email. “Research has shown that for every H-1B visa issued, technology companies create five U.S. jobs.”
Bold notes that much more should be done by Congress to make it easier to retain talented foreign nationals who want to work in the U.S. permanently. We agree.
But for now, it is refreshing to see common sense prevail in at least one area of immigration. For all its present woes, the United States remains immensely attractive to billions of people around the world. Using our visa policies to attract highly skilled individuals from this group – individuals who would help our struggling economy to thrive – is a great idea.

The number of visas for foreign workers has not changed in the past several years despite the economic recession and slow recovery in the United States. Should the government adjust (limit or expand) the number of such visas depending on the nation’s unemployment rate?

No. Why limit our ability to compete globally and to recruit the best talent from around the world? The national unemployment rate is an important factor, but it should not be the only determinant for limiting or expanding visas. The national unemployment rate does not reflect individual state or regional unemployment numbers, and it certainly does not present an accurate gauge for industries that need to recruit specific talent. The system for work visas should be more market-driven, and it should reflect our nation’s need for immigrants with sought-after skills. For example, the H-1B visa cap should be lifted entirely. Our economy relies on innovation. We should remove artificial barriers to economic growth. Fundamentally, we need to prepare U.S. workers and educate U.S. students. We should be educating and training Americans to fill all job openings in our economy. Yes we must train Americans, but at the same time, we must not limit our ability to grow, recruit and compete globally.
Ruben Barrales, S.D. Regional Chamber of Commerce president, CEO
Yes. Given economic conditions since 2008, the rational approach would be to reduce legal immigration across the board. We admitted 10,501,505 immigrants between 2001 and 2010, including over 1 million every year since 2005, in spite of unacceptably high levels of unemployment. Of those, we issued 148,343 “green cards” to foreign workers, slightly more than in 2009 but lower than the average of 162,531 from 2001-2009. In addition, we experienced a massive increase in temporary non-immigrant workers in 2010 — 2,816,525, compared with 1,703,697 in 2009, and much higher than the 1,646,329 average from 2001 to 2009. Why any country would import so many new immigrants and foreign workers under current economic conditions is beyond reason. It would be much wiser to encourage employers to hire those already here, rather than relying on cheap, exploitable foreign workers. Furthermore, there are ways to encourage citizens and legal immigrants to study science, math and engineering, if there are real shortages in those fields.
Peter Nunez, Former U.S. attorney in San Diego
No. The temporary employment visas should not be based on the unemployment rate but rather on employer labor needs. Yearly, the government allocates 65,000 H-1B visas for professional workers with a bachelor’s degree in specialty occupations and 20,000 visas for those with master’s degrees from U.S. universities. Despite the recession, the 85,000 visas are exhausted before the end of the fiscal year, verifying that employers are unsuccessful in filling jobs with U.S. workers. As to permanent employment visas, the cap should be increased to meet the labor needs of employers. Typically, an employer wishing to permanently hire a professional worker must first obtain a certification from the U.S. Department of Labor, demonstrating that after extensive recruitment, no willing and able U.S. workers were found. In particular, professional nurses have been in short supply for decades and do not require a labor certification. However, whether a labor certification is required or not, workers must currently wait six years to obtain a visa.
Lilia Velasquez, immigration attorney and adjunct professor
Yes. The government’s visa quota system for temporary workers fails to address the realities and necessities of the U.S. economy. The reality is that, even in amid economic distress, there is demand for both high-skilled, high-wage and low-skilled, low-wage labor. The former mostly fall into the H1-A visa category that is used for computer programmers, software engineers and other “techies” in short supply. The latter fall into the H2-A and H2-B visa category for jobs that would otherwise likely move overseas (like meat packing) because of high production costs and/or jobs that are undesirable to many U.S. citizens (like washing dishes and cleaning toilets). In recent years, the U.S. government has significantly increased the number of H2-A and H2-B visas. Continuing to increase that number — and make it less complicated and expensive for employers — would move people out of the shadow economy, and thereby raise labor standards and wages for all low-income, low-skilled workers.

The nation’s growing population of young Latinos, many of them immigrants or children of immigrants, are primed to succeed retiring baby boomers in the workforce. Should baby boomers be concerned with making sure this group has enough educational, economic and community resources to succeed?

Peter Nunez, former U.S. attorney in San Diego
No. Why single out “young Latinos” and “immigrants or children of immigrants”? Shouldn’t we be concerned that all young people — regardless of ethnicity and immigrant status — have enough educational, economic and community resources? The genius of America is that millions of immigrants who have arrived since Columbus have assimilated and prospered without an elaborate welfare state. They expected to succeed without the taxpayer paying the costs of immigration. History proves the success of that system, so why are taxpayers today expected to pay the enormous costs to support the million new legal immigrants admitted each year, plus 12 million illegal aliens whom the government continues to tolerate? Immigrants should be expected to succeed on their own, without society taking responsibility for their own innate desire to grow, improve and obtain an education. Prior waves of immigrants did, so why should things be different now?
David Shirk, director of the Trans-Border Institute at USD
Yes, assuming baby boomers do not want to be cared for by an exploitable or unruly underclass. While a solid public education system used to be the great leveler of U.S. society, the foundation of our merit-based economy has crumbled. Today, whether it means living in the right school district or saving for college, it is mainly those children whose families can afford a quality education who advance and/or stay ahead. The education gap is especially large for our country’s 50 million Latinos, about a third of whom are under the age of 18. While Latinos value education and enroll their children in K-12 at higher than average rates, they tend to enter low-performing schools and are twice as likely to drop out as the general population. Without access to a quality education, Langston Hughes might ask, will the Latino American dream “dry up like a raisin in the sun … or does it explode?” Let’s not find out.
Ruben Barrales, San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce president, CEO
.
Yes. As a baby boomer, I am concerned that the growing population of young people be prepared to enter the workforce to keep the U.S. economy competitive, and to contribute to Social Security to help with my future retirement! As the child of immigrants, I am concerned with making sure that young Latinos (and all children) have the opportunity to succeed. We must improve the quality of public education with schools where student academic achievement is the main focus, and where parent participation is welcomed and encouraged. As an American, I am concerned that we preserve and protect our free-enterprise system to allow native-born Americans, as well as immigrants, an opportunity to work hard and to pursue their American dream. And as a San Diegan, I am concerned that we provide basic public services such as public safety and health services for those most in need in our community
Lilia Velasquez, immigration attorney and adjunct professor of law
Yes. Due to rising labor-market demands and vacancies left by baby boomers, employers and academic institutions need to prepare a highly skilled talent pool. The nuclear-energy industry has taken the lead, training students through academic institution partnerships. Also, larger numbers of Latinos are pursing high-skill diplomas. These efforts are not sufficient to meet the demand for high-skilled jobs, as demonstrated by the fact that the 85,000 cap for H-1B visas for 2013 was exhausted last week. Since 1998, Congress has tried to reduce dependence on foreign labor; it enacted the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act mandating that employers sponsoring H-1B workers help fund skills training for Americans. In 2011, there was $220 million available for training grants and yet we have a high-tech labor shortage. More resources need to be invested to prepare Latinos to replace baby boomers, but immigration quotas for foreign workers also need to rise if the U.S. is to maintain its competitive edge in the world.

ARE THERE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR SAN DIEGO IN THE IMMIGRATION REFORM PROPOSALS BEFORE CONGRESS?
The San Diego Union-Tribune
February 3, 2013 Sunday

Marney Cox: San Diego Association of Governments
YES: Most Americans agree that the current U.S. immigration system requires fixing. Less clear are the effects new immigrants have on wages, jobs and the economy. Studies suggest that “over time” immigrants raise the overall standard of living of American workers by boosting wages and lowering prices, primarily because new immigrants and U.S.-born workers generally do not compete for the same jobs. But what about during times when the economy is expanding slowly, the unemployment rate is high and residents are leaving the labor force, frustrated that they cannot find a job? To ensure success, fixing the immigration system should include strategies to prevent the current below trend economic conditions from becoming worse.
Kelly Cunningham: National University
YES: If immigration reform means establishing a fair and workable system of legal immigration, then San Diego substantially benefits from the tax revenues of newly legalized immigrant workers lawfully employed and contributing to society. Allowing foreign nationals, often educated here, to fill professions under employer-sponsored H-1B programs will benefit San Diego technology companies unable to find skilled workers to fill such positions. An equitable way to deal with illegal immigrants without sending a message that America’s laws can be broken with impunity is also critical. Achieving legal status should not be easier not following rules rather than by following legal processes.
Alan Gin: University of San Diego
YES: One aspect of the proposal calls for improved border security, which would mean more jobs for border agents and a boost to San Diego companies specializing in security technology. Also helping the local economy would be the proposal to increase the number of green cards issued to immigrants who earn advanced degrees in the U.S., including our local universities. That would allow more of those degree holders to stay and contribute to the economy, particularly in areas such as science and engineering. Finally, the pathway to citizenship would lead to those taking the path becoming income tax payers, in addition to providing more social stability.
James Hamilton: UC San Diego
YES: It would certainly benefit those individuals who are given an easier path to citizenship, enabling some of them to get better-paying jobs. To the extent they become more productive as a result of getting citizenship, there are benefits to all of us, for example in the form of higher taxes collected and a broader consumer market for goods and services. On the other hand, it also means more competition for the jobs for which many people who are already citizens are also looking.
Dan Seiver: San Diego State University
YES: While comprehensive immigration reform is in the country’s best interest, the most important benefit for San Diego would be a proposed reform package that includes a sharp increase in H-1B visas. These science and technology visas are capped nationally at 65,000, which is far below the demand by science and technology firms, given that the U.S. is not producing enough “homegrown” STEM graduates. If the H-1B visas were doubled or tripled, science and technology firms in San Diego and the nation could increase staffing, produce more innovative products and services, and perhaps hire the next Sergey Brin (cofounder of Google, who was born in the USSR)!
Lynn Reaser: Point Loma Nazarene University
YES: Immigration reform would strengthen San Diego’s economy in many important ways. Visa reform, allowing graduates with vital science, technology, engineering, and math skills to remain here would provide critical talent to many of our key industry segments. Giving a clear path to citizenship to those who have been living in the shadows would allow them to more fully participate in the economy by becoming homeowners, for example. As full citizens, they could become integral parts of local communities, supporting schools and other activities. It is time to erase the fears and uncertainties which for too long have weighed on our region.
Norm Miller: CoStar Group
YES: San Diego and California will benefit greatly from an expanded and legalized guest worker program as the vast majority of all agricultural workers are currently illegal, while the industry is totally dependent on these workers. Other industries also depend heavily on illegal workers such as roofing contractors, cleaning services, landscape services, and even hospital cleaning staff, all hired through subcontractors. The greatest benefit would be the lessened risk of injuries or death trying to cross or stop border crossings in unsafe ways. The path to citizenship program would have less immediate benefit, but is the right thing to do.
Gary London: The London Group
yes: Our proximity to Mexico means that San Diego disproportionately benefits from reform. First-generation immigrants, in particular, are the hardest-working, most- motivated members of the work force. They benefit their communities and the economy. If they come out of the shadows, then they also pay taxes, contribute to Social Security and Medicare in a positive way because they are mostly young. On the skilled side of the equation, because San Diego is the home to large high-tech clusters, immigration reform would mean that highly skilled (and paid) jobs would be filled so that the foreigner whom we educate would be motivated to stay. It is right to correct the system and offer up the American dream to today’s immigrants.

JACOBS: IMMIGRATION ISSUES COULD HURT S.D. ECONOMY

The lack of U.S. immigration reform could stifle economic growth in San Diego County and pigeonhole the region as a place that fails to attract major companies, said Qualcomm founding Chairman Irwin Jacobs at a local real estate conference on Friday.
Technology and life-science companies in the county, like mobile chip maker Qualcomm, are having an increasingly hard time recruiting qualified workers because many of them are foreign graduates who can’t secure visas to work legally in this country, said Jacobs, at an event hosted by USD’s Burnham-Moores Center for Real Estate.
Those who fail to lock in visas take their knowledge and experience elsewhere, helping competing businesses abroad, Jacobs said. Another issue is a shortage of native-born graduates in the STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
“Particularly graduate school, over half of the students are foreign-born,” said Jacobs, addressing real estate and business leaders at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront. “We’d love to hire them, but then we run into constraints. The number of H-1B visas that are available are limited ... In fact, they often run out the first or second day they become available.”
Ernest Rady, executive chairman of San Diego-based real estate investment trust American Assets Trust, echoed Irwin’s sentiments about the need for change in immigration policy.
“Immigration is a lifeblood for this country, not only because it brings innovation ... but it also brings capital,” said Rady, who criticized a divided Capitol for the lack of progress in this area.
These comments come about a month after Paul Jacobs, Qualcomm’s chief executive, met with President Barack Obama to discuss similar issues.
Obama has stressed immigration reform as one of his priorities this year. He told religious leaders he wants to see proposed reform legislation within the next two months, national media reported on Friday.
To mitigate brain drain, Rady suggests nurturing the firms we already have. Jacobs suggests helping up-and-coming segments of the life-science and technology sectors. One example is the growing industry of personalized medicine, which includes technology that can measure and monitor body vitals.
Other mentioned challenges affecting San Diego’s economic progress include:
•?Aging infrastructure like roads that need to be fixed and updated. The issue: money.
•?Local cuts resulting from sequestration. The life-sciences sector, partially dependent on federal funding, will suffer because the cuts mean fewer research hours and fewer medical advances, Irwin Jacobs said.
•?No advancement in the discussion to bring a second airport to the San Diego region. Over time, San Diego is expected to outgrow its only airport and will need a supplemental one to handle the future demand for international flights, Jacobs said.
Friday’s conference also touched on the residential real estate market.
Doug Duncan, chief economist of mortgage giant Fannie Mae, said the U.S. housing market continues to improve. Home prices are being pushed up particularly in areas with a heavy investor presence, such as San Diego.
Investors are buying up real estate in bulk and many homeowners can’t sell because they’re underwater on their mortgage. Those two factors, Duncan said, have contributed to lower-than-normal inventory, which has helped push up prices.

HIGH-TECH FIELD EYEING VISA CAPS AS IMMIGRATION REFORM PROCEEDS
The San Diego Union-Tribune
March 13, 2013 Wednesday

High-tech companies and universities in San Diego County and nationwide are tracking the immigration-reform debate in Washington.
Their interest? Significantly raising the annual caps on the number of visas for high-skilled foreigners to work in the United States, streamlining the bureaucratic process that companies must navigate to hire such employees and lessening the restrictions placed on scientists, engineers, computer programmers and others with these visas.
While congressional lawmakers and advocacy groups have focused mainly on what to do with the roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country and how to better secure the nation’s borders, those in high-tech industries said their visa component is equally important to the nation, particularly its economy.
The discussion is expanding with just weeks to go before the application filing period for H-1B visas in 2014 begins on April 1. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allocates 65,000 H-1B visas annually, with an additional 20,000 for people with advanced degrees.
This year the cap is expected to be reached within the first week. It took two months to hit the limit last year, and the year before that it took until November. In 2007 and 2008, before the Great Recession really took hold, the cap was reached on the first filing day — April 1.
“Even if you have the most highly qualified employee, the most sought-after employee from a foreign country, you can’t guarantee anything,” said Justine Storch, manager of agency liaison for the American Council on International Personnel, a membership organization in Washington, D.C., for companies with at least 500 employees and one office abroad.
Industry leaders said the lack of qualified citizens in STEM fields — science, technology, engineering and mathematics — pushes companies to hire foreign workers or to try to help international students with advanced degrees from U.S. colleges stay in the country.
For those who want to start a business, a different visa is required — but the application procedure and the odds for obtaining that visa are similarly challenging.
“To have this immigration policy is really silly,” said Martina Musteen, a professor in the College of Business Administration at San Diego State University.
Musteen’s focus is international entrepreneurship. “It’s a known fact that immigrants have always been important for innovation and for starting new businesses in the U.S.,” she said. “The barriers to it don’t make any sense.”
Opponents of raising the visa caps said the problem is less about qualified employees as it is about cheap foreign labor.
Norman Matloff, a professor of computer science at the University of California Davis, said foreign workers are paid less, lack some rights that U.S. citizens possess and have less career mobility because their visas are tied to their current employer.
“By far, the most important reform would be to fix the definition of the legally required wage for hiring H-1Bs,” he said. “Currently, the legal definition is full of loopholes that allow employers to legally underpay foreign workers.”
Executives at scientific and high-tech businesses said they pay fair wages and invest time and additional resources in foreign workers because they truly need them. The average cost of sponsoring a worker for an H-1B visa is about $3,000.
“Companies are not doing this on a whim,” Storch said.
Judy Ohrn Hicks, senior vice president of human resources at Accelrys in Sorrento Valley, has five applications ready to be filed next month. She almost had six, but ruled out a candidate for a job that had to filled quickly. That’s because people who apply on April 1 and are granted an H-1B visa cannot begin work until Oct. 1.
“We (are) a small company, but we need to be globally competitive,” Ohrn Hicks said. “There has to be intelligent and commercial discussion around it. This is not a political issue, this is an economic and business issue.”
Accelrys makes software to help companies manage their operations. About 10 percent of its 650 workers currently hold H-1B visas, and many more started out with such a visa.
At Achates Power, which is developing a fuel-efficient, low-cost and sustainable internal-combustion engine, about 10 percent of the 50 workers hold H-1B visas and about one-third were born abroad, said David Johnson, president and CEO.
“Anything that can be done to make (the visa process) faster and more flexible and more real-world is greatly appreciated,” Johnson said.
He was once prohibited from sending an Indian employee to his native country for business because of H-1B restrictions, even though that worker was the best man for the assignment.
In previous years, Congress has tried to address businesses’ concerns but could not pass related legislation. Now, several ideas are being floated that could become part of a comprehensive immigration bill:
•?The Staple Act: would give a green card to foreign students when they earn at least a master’s degree in the United States.
•?The Immigration Innovation Act: would increase the annual H-1B cap from 65,000 to a range of 115,000 to 300,000 depending on the economy. Also would allow unlimited H-1B visas for graduates with qualified advanced degrees.
•?The Start Up Act 3.0: would give entrepreneur visas to certain people who can raise capital, launch a company in the United States and hire at least five U.S. workers.
“By doing these things, you’ll see more innovation going on,” said Alexander Wallin, a Swedish graduate of the University of California San Diego and founder of Sprinklebit, a social investment platform.
Wallin started his company while he was in college and was able to stay in the U.S. for one year after graduation. He applied for a special visa for entrepreneurs and said the process was long and expensive, partly because the government lost his paperwork. Wallin eventually had to leave the country so he would not fall out of legal status.
For five months, he tried to manage his company from Stockholm, Sweden. He returned to San Diego last month.
“Because I could not be here,” he said, “we lost two to three months of development time.”

Question: Is expansion of the H-1B program, which provides visas to high-skilled workers from abroad, necessary for reforming the nation’s immigration system?
The San Diego Union-Tribune
March 24, 2013 Sunday

Section: SD IN DEPTH; Pg. SD-2

John Skrentny, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California San Diego
There are two ways to answer. Is H-1B expansion necessary for sufficient votes to pass comprehensive immigration reform? Some action in skilled immigration is necessary (though not necessarily H-1B expansion) because many in Congress want this done and have been stymied for years. Is expansion necessary for America? This is unclear. Tech workers’ wages have not risen dramatically, as would be expected if there was a serious shortage. Firms say cost pressures prevent them from training Americans, but H-1B workers are easily exploited. Less restrictive visas may be preferable, as well as a focus on attracting the most advanced skills.
Lilia Velasquez, San Diego immigration attorney and adjunct professor of law
Yes, immigration reform should be comprehensive and address all areas of our immigration system, including changing the cap on H-1B visas. U.S. universities are not producing enough professionals in the (science, technology, engineering and math) occupations, forcing employers to hire foreign workers. The number of visas for high-skilled workers (85,000 per year) is insufficient to meet U.S. labor demands. In recent years, the quota has been reached in the first few months of the fiscal year, resulting in significant losses of revenue for U.S. businesses. The number of H-1B visas should be driven by demand, not an artificial quota. It is the only way the U.S. will be able to maintain its edge in the global market.
Peter Nunez, former U.S. attorney in San Diego
No. There is no reason to believe that America cannot produce enough highly skilled workers to meet the demand. These are exactly the kinds of jobs that America should want to produce — and is perfectly capable of producing.
What the proponents of an expanded H-1B program want are cheaper foreign workers who will work for lower wages and fewer benefits than an American-born worker, workers who are tied to a specific employer/sponsor, which creates the potential for abuse.
If there is indeed a shortage of high-skilled workers, it is a shortage of workers willing to work for below-market-level wages.
Ruben Barrales, immediate past president and CEO of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce and currently head of the Republican political action committee GROW Elect
Yes. We need to update the current immigration system to help American workers and companies compete in the 21st century. An expansion of the H-1B program, including raising the cap on H-1B visas to meet demand, will provide an opportunity for the U.S. to attract and retain the best and brightest immigrants from around the world. These diverse and highly skilled immigrants help high-tech and other companies grow, which creates additional private-sector jobs for American workers. In the long-run, limiting H1B visas could lead to losing competitiveness and potential for job growth of high-tech companies here at home.
Rhonda Deniston, North County regional director for Stop Taxing Us, a conservative taxpayer advocacy/tea party group
The expansion of H-1B visas is not necessary in reforming immigration. It is always welcoming to open the door to the best and brightest of immigrants. However ... the current administration continues to fail when it comes to any attempt to slow illegal immigration. As long as that is the case, no other reform will have any impact on the opinion of immigration in the eyes of legal, taxpaying citizens who feel there is a serious national-security threat that is continuously ignored along our porous borders.

Key components of the immigration outline released Tuesday:
Path to citizenship
•Most of the nation’s estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants who meet various requirements would gain provisional residency status for 10 years.
•Afterward, they would be allowed to apply for green cards if certain border-security standards have been met. The chance to become U.S. citizens would come three years afterward.
•Most applicants would have to pay a total of $2,000 in fines, pay back taxes, learn English, remain employed and pass a criminal background check.
•To qualify, applicants must have arrived in the United States before Jan. 1, 2012.
•Certain youths would be able to obtain green cards in five years and U.S. citizenship right afterward.
Border security
•U.S. Department of Homeland Security would receive $3 billion to improve border security through surveillance drones and 3,500 additional customs agents.
•The same agency would get $1.5 billion for border fencing.
•Within five years, the agency must achieve 100 percent surveillance of the U.S.-Mexico border and apprehend at least 90 percent of people trying to cross illegally in high-risk sectors — those where more than 30,000 people are apprehended annually.
•If the agency does not meet these benchmarks, a border commission composed of governors and attorneys general from border states would be given five years and designated funding to implement more effective measures.
•Within five years, U.S. employers must start using the E-Verify database system to screen workers’ immigration status. All noncitizens would need to show a “biometric work authorization card” or a “biometric green card.”
•The government would implement an exit-and-entry tracking system at ports of entry to determine whether foreign visitors or workers have overstayed their visas.
H-1B high-skilled visas
•Visas for workers with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math would rise from 65,000 to 110,000 per year. In future years, the cap could rise to as much as 180,000, depending on job-market conditions.
•Require employers with large numbers of H-1B visas would have to pay higher salaries and fees compared with current amounts.
Guest worker ‘W visa’ program
•Establish a program to oversee 20,000 foreigners in low-skilled jobs starting in 2015. Number of annual visas in this category would increase to 75,000 by 2019.
•Construction companies would be limited to a maximum of 15,000 “W visas” per year.
•Create a federal bureau to analyze employment data and recommend annual caps on guest-worker visas beginning in 2020. Yearly ceiling would be 200,000.
•Companies could not hire guest workers to replace better-paid permanent staff, or to augment staffing during a union strike or other work stoppage.
•Wages must be comparable to those of other employees with similar experience and qualification in a particular company, or must be the prevailing wage level for that field and in that geographic area.
•Would include a “safety valve” to allow more visas over the annual cap as long as employers pay higher wages.
Farm worker H-2A program
•Visas for agriculture workers would be limited to 337,000 over three years.
•Wages would be based on a survey of labor-market data for various farming jobs.
Changes to family visa program
•Would allow unlimited number of visas per year for foreign spouses, children and parents of U.S. citizens and permanent legal residents.
•Eighteen months after the law takes effect, it would eliminate visas reserved for foreign brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, and married children older than 30.
•Would cancel diversity visa program starting in 2015 and instead create a new, merit-based visa system based on family ties and work skills.
•Certain deportees with a parent, child or spouse who is a citizen or legal permanent resident in the United States would be allowed to apply for reunification here.

Pedro Rios, chairman, San Diego Immigrant Rights Consortium: “The pathway to citizenship is too long and burdened with overzealous border-enforcement triggers, which are out of touch with border communities’ needs. Mandatory E-Verify is also problematic. Improvements with input from community consultation are necessary to make it palatable.”
Peter Nunez, former U.S. attorney in San Diego: “Fundamentally, this is an ‘amnesty first, enforcement maybe’ promise that dramatically increases legal immigration. Any proposal that delays implementation of workplace verification is not serious. It rewards violations of our immigration, tax, Social Security, false-identity, document-fraud and criminal laws.”
Ruben Barrales, immediate past president and CEO of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce and current head of the Republican political action committee GROW Elect: “Its focus on economic needs is a good start. I am intrigued by the comprehensive nature of the plan, which includes some positive changes for high-skilled workers, low-skilled worker needs and a potential path to citizenship for those who qualify.”
John Skrentny, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California San Diego: “In the last comprehensive immigration reform — 1986! — legislation arose through cooperation between the Senate and the House. Today, the bill is from the Senate alone. A key unknown is the strategy of House Republicans, most of whom represent safe, overwhelmingly Republican districts.” Rhonda Deniston, North County regional director for Stop Taxing Us, a conservative taxpayer advocacy/tea party group: “Americans want meaningful border security, particularly on the heels of the Boston bombings. The bill calls for $3 billion in additional border security and $1.5 billion for fencing. However, citizens have lost faith and confidence in the (Department of Homeland Security) because of current relaxed border enforcement.”
The Rev. Madison T. Shockley II, pastor of Pilgrim United Church of Christ in Carlsbad: “This historic legislation is a great step toward that ‘more perfect union’ that we strive to become with each generation. Eleven million hardworking, undocumented persons live among us and deserve the dignity of citizenship, especially those brought as children.”
Lilia Velasquez, San Diego immigration attorney and adjunct professor of law: “The proposal is very generous because it benefits those who came here by Dec. 31, 2011, and increases the number of visas for high-skilled professionals. The concern is that legalization may not occur if the border is not considered 90 percent secure within five years.”
Ted Hilton of the Taxpayer Revolution Committee in San Diego: “The senators originally announced the border would be secure before any legalization, but the opposite will now occur, which will likely defeat the bill. Immigration laws should be passed on a piecemeal basis, only after a bill to end entitlement fraud.”
Alexander Wallin, a Swedish graduate from the University of California San Diego and founder of Sprinklebit.com, a social investment platform: “Raising the H-1B cap will help the U.S. technology sector recruit and retain talent and entrepreneurs like myself. The new ‘W visa’ is a great attempt to reduce illegal workers. And how will they structure the startup visas? It’s barely mentioned.” — COMPILED BY STAFF WRITER ELIZABETH AGUILERA

BILL WOULD BOOST NUMBER OF GREEN CARDS TO STUDENTS; Issa says increase will help create jobs and retain best, brightest
The San Diego Union-Tribune
May 24, 2013 Friday

Rep. Darrell Issa of Vista on Thursday helped introduce a bill that would grant up to 55,000 green cards each year to qualified foreign-born students who have earned advanced degrees in science, technology, mathematics and engineering in the United States.
The legislation also would boost — from 65,000 to 155,000 — the annual number of visas issued to high-skilled workers from abroad.
Issa joined fellow Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia in introducing the measure in the House Judiciary Committee. The legislation is called the SKILLS Visa Act, short for the Supplying Knowledge-Based Immigrants and Lifting Levels of STEM Visas Act.
“(It) will allow the best and brightest foreign graduates of American universities to stay in the U.S., encourage entrepreneurs and investors to grow our economy, and create American jobs,” Issa said, adding that the bill “will modernize immigration laws to help our growing technology sector.”
The measure is the latest in a series of individual bills introduced in the House to address immigration. This approach contrasts with the comprehensive immigration legislation that the Senate Judiciary Committee approved this week. The broad bill, which is expected to advance to the full Senate floor next month, also includes provisions for increasing the number of high-skill visas, which are commonly known as H-1B visas.
Goodlatte has been critical of the broad Senate legislation and prefers that Congress take a more piecemeal approach.
Advocates of immigration reform favor the large Senate bill because it pairs a pathway to legalization for unauthorized immigrants with measures addressing other aspects of immigration. They are concerned that conservatives who prefer a piecemeal approach would ratchet up border security, boost interior enforcement of existing immigration laws and take other steps before considering, if ever, what should happen to the estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. without permission.
Those who dislike one major immigration bill said increased border security, mandatory employment verification and other related actions must be realized before the nation deals with any allowances for the unauthorized.
This week, a group of conservative activists — including San Diegans Peter Nunez, a former U.S. attorney; Dawn Wildman of the Southern California Tax Revolt Coalition; and former San Diego mayor Roger Hedgecock (who has a show on U-T TV) — signed an open letter against the Senate bill.
“Many of us support various parts of the legislation, but the overall package is so unsatisfactory that the Senate would do better to start over from scratch,” they wrote.
On Thursday, Issa described the STEM Visas bill as versatile.
“(It) would improve our immigration system regardless of whether it passes as a stand-alone bill or as part of a larger package,” he wrote in an email.
In addition to the provisions for advanced-degree graduates and H-1B workers, the legislation would repeal the current per-country limits on employment visas, create a new visa program for entrepreneurs and strengthen the existing visa program for certain investors.
“Although high-skilled immigrants are often in demand by American employers, many of them end up on the green-card waiting list for years,” Goodlatte said Thursday. “Consequently, many of these foreign workers and students go back to their home countries and work for one of our global competitors.”
Industry groups that support the measure include Compete America, inSPIRE STEM USA, the Information Technology Industry Council and the Consumer Electronics Association.

Body


Border security
Sets out a series of requirements, such as doubling the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents, that must be achieved over 10 years before any unauthorized immigrants can move from the “provisional” category to green-card status.
Path to citizenship
The estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. without permission can generally obtain “provisional” status six months after enactment of the bill as long as certain conditions have been met. These include paying a $500 fine and not having a felony conviction or more than two misdemeanors.
High-skilled workers
The cap on the H-1B visa program would rise from 65,000 a year to 110,000 a year, with 25,000 more set aside for people with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering or math from a U.S. school. The cap could go as high as 180,000 a year depending on demand.
Low-skilled workers
A new W visa would allow up to 200,000 low-skilled workers a year into the country for jobs in construction, long-term care, hospitality and other industries. Also, a new agriculture worker visa program would be established to replace the existing program.
Family immigration
Under current law, U.S. citizens can generally sponsor spouses, children and siblings to come to the U.S. The bill would limit such sponsorship to spouses, single children and married children under age 31.
Employment verification
Within four years, all employers must use the E-Verify computer system to check their workers’ legal status.

COMMERCE SECRETARY: BUSINESS BACKS SENATE MEASURE ON IMMIGRATION; Pritzker finds 'almost uniform support' for reform during recent round-table talks

Penny Pritzker, the billionaire Hyatt Hotel heiress and accomplished real estate developer, in June became President Barack Obama’s secretary of commerce. During a break Monday at the North American Competitiveness & Innovation Conference she talked with U-T San Diego. That discussion has been edited for clarity and brevity.
Q: What are you hearing from CEOs about taking the North American Free Trade Agreement to the next level?
A: Today is about how do we strengthen the North American platform; how do we build on the success of NAFTA. We have $1.1 trillion of trade annually; 460 million people in this marketplace. Our goal is economic growth and job creation.
Q: How does immigration fit into that paradigm?
A: In the Senate immigration reform bill, which the administration supports, there’s a combination of things. Obviously, border security, and a path to citizenship for those who are undocumented at this time. But what’s also included is a great expansion of our H1B visa program; family reunification, which allows people to work together; there is stapling a green card to a master’s or a Ph.D. if you get that here in the United States in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields. All of these are business generators.
The studies have shown that $1.4 trillion of economic growth would be associated with passing immigration reform over the next 20 years. What we know about our immigrants is they form businesses. They tend to form small businesses. I think 30 percent of new businesses in the U.S. are formed by immigrants. So there’s an enormous opportunity with immigration reform, and it’s got terrific positive economic outcomes associated with it, as well as supporting additional skilled labor, etc.
Q: What are you hearing from organized labor about the Senate immigration bill?
A: That would be more of a question for the White House in terms of where labor is. My job has been to really do outreach to the business community about immigration reform. I went on a listening tour; during my first 100 days I was in 13 cities in about six or seven weeks, had 22 roundtables, met with over 350 business leaders. There was almost uniform support for the immigration reform.
Q: What are your priorities to improve North American economic integration?
A: Foreign direct investment ... we have companies that invest in all three countries, and we want to encourage companies to continue that; regulatory cooperation ... goods, as they move back and forth across the border, sometimes three or four times, there’s not a regulatory impediment to that; infrastructure ... we need to invest in the entry points, expanding them; tourism ... making that easier, what are the impediments; innovation ... how do we collectively help our entrepreneurs?
Q: What are you telling the president about corporate taxation?
A: I’m 100 percent in favor of the president’s goal to move forward corporate tax reform. And he and I had that conversation as recently as a week ago. I think it’s very much important for American competitiveness.
The president has proposed that in corporate tax reform that there will be a one-time revenue that will occur; that we use that to fund the going-forward infrastructure needs of the country at large, including the border, which is obviously a big issue.

SOME CHANGES PROPOSED FOR SKILLED WORKERS
The San Diego Union-Tribune

Technology and biotech companies have long sought greater numbers of skilled workers, and have urged federal lawmakers to boost the number of visas issued under the H-1B program.
Thursday night, President Barack Obama did not propose such an increase. That type of change to the H-1B program falls outside the authority of an executive order; it would require action from Congress.
About 85,000 H-1B visas are issued each year, and a total of about 650,000 H-1B workers are currently employed in the U.S., said Ron Hira, a professor at Howard University and a research associate at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
Qualcomm is a major supporter of immigration reform for highly skilled workers.
In a statement before the president’s speech, the chipmaker said: “We feel it is in the best interest of our company and the nation to retain top talent in the United States. It just makes no sense to educate the world’s brightest engineers here, and then send them back to their home countries so they can compete against us.”
Toward that end, the president intends to expand and extend the Optional Practical Training program, in which foreign students and recent graduates from U.S. universities with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math — or STEM fields — can get jobs here.
Currently, they are allowed to work in the U.S. for 29 months before having to get a temporary work visa or leave the country. There are about 100,000 such workers in the U.S. today, Hira said.
In the life-science industry, companies seek H-1B visas primarily for jobs involving software development and for certain kinds of scientists. Biocom, San Diego’s life-science trade group, has supported raising the number of these visas since the late 1990s.
Meanwhile, the president’s executive order will allow spouses of some H-1B visa holders to legally get jobs — as long as they’re on track to receiving permanent residency “green cards.”
Obama also aims to expand immigration options for foreign entrepreneurs who meet certain criteria for creating jobs, attracting investment and paying taxes in the U.S.

ISSA QUESTIONS EDISON'S HIRING; Congressman says apparent use of visa program is 'disturbing'

Congressman Darrell Issa called Southern California Edison’s apparent use of the federal H-1B visa program to replace part of its workforce “deeply disturbing” in a statement issued Friday.
The utility, which provides electricity to much of Southern California but not San Diego County, is laying off about 400 information technology workers and replacing them with foreign workers under the non-immigrant worker visa program. An estimated additional 100 employees are leaving voluntarily.
Southern California Edison told the Los Angeles Times last year that it was shrinking its workforce in an effort to streamline its management and operations. The company said in a statement this weekend that it is replacing the American workers with employees from two consulting services in India.
“This transition will lead to enhancements that deliver faster and more efficient tools and applications for services that customers rely on,” Edison’s statement said.
The company said that the vendor selection process was competitive and included some U.S.-based companies.
“SCE needs to compete for customers by providing them safe, reliable and affordable electricity with quality service,” the company said. “This can best be achieved by continuing to be mindful of SCE’s responsibility to spend customers’ money prudently.”
In a statement posted to his website, Issa said: “Based on the information currently available, this appears to be an example of precisely what the H-1B visa is not intended to be: a program to simply replace American workers en masse with cheap labor from overseas.”
Issa, R-Vista, said immigration law requires employers to certify that hiring an H-1B applicant “will not adversely affect the working conditions of workers similarly employed.” He also called for new legislation with stronger wage protections to help prevent companies from using the program to replace existing workers with lower-cost imported labor.
“I urge Southern California Edison to be forthcoming in releasing information about the process behind this decision, and I look forward to a thorough and transparent account of what attempts were made to ensure this major hiring decision adheres to the very clear statutes outlining the intended structure of the H-1B visa program,” he said.
Russ Harrison, director of government relations for IEEE-USA, the largest professional organization for electrical engineers in the United States, said he’s pleased Issa recognizes that Edison might have misused the visa program, but it isn’t the only company to have done so.
“This use of H-1Bs to outsource American jobs is endemic, and it’s been going on for a decade or so,” Harrison said.
He also appreciates that Issa wants to make changes to end abuse of the skilled-worker visas, but says that stronger wage protections won’t suffice. Outsourcing needs to be banned outright, he said, and companies held accountable for their hiring actions.
It appears in Edison’s case, he said, “You can’t even pretend there weren’t Americans to do the job, because Americans were doing the job until they got laid off.”
The Department of Labor website says the H-1B program is intended to “help employers who cannot otherwise obtain needed business skills and abilities from the U.S. workforce” by allowing the temporary employment of qualified people in specialty occupations, who are not otherwise authorized to work in the United States.

Glad to see Brownies' effort to rectify slight

With sadness I read about 7-year-old Daphyne Watson (“Rising above racism,” March 25) being denied membership in Brownies 55 years ago because of her skin color.
I’m sure that today’s Girl Scouts and all of us are appalled by this. Thank you to the young members and leaders of Brownie Troop 4044 for rectifying this injustice by making her an honorary member and giving her badges she rightfully earned by her long history of service to others.
With her beautiful smile, I’m certain that she would have been leading the troop in sales of Thin Mints. You go, Daphyne.

Wind power deserves government support
I assume that Larry Campbell (“Wind industry must make it on its own,” March 23), while opposed to government subsidies for solar, apparently has no such qualms about government subsidies allotted to oil, gas and coal, calculated by “Oil Changer International” at $37.5 billion per year, and other organizations from $10 billion to $52 billion, exclusive of other costs picked up by taxpayers.
And let’s not forget the 45-cents-per-gallon subsidies to our farmers who produce ethanol.
Continuing on with taxpayer-supported production, how about that factory in town that produces professional football?
Federal subsidies are a historic part and parcel of our so-called “free enterprise” system. Even the railroads, with one exception, were built with government assistance.

Don’t be fooled by the H-1B visa ploy
Another season of attempting to increase the number of foreign engineers working in the U.S. has begun (“Google chairman appeals for immigration changes,” March 15).
No matter how executives try to disguise this, the net result is an attempt to lower the cost of the engineering staff, raising profits at the expense of the workers. Higher profits equals higher stock prices equals increased executive bonuses.
This works because H-1B visa engineers work for less pay than citizen engineers.
Our middle class is shrinking and engineering salaries have been virtually stagnant in real dollars for a decade, while executive compensation has ballooned. Time to let our elected leaders know that this is unacceptable. No increase in H-1B visas.

Stopping progress won’t send message
I’m glad “the conversation is now about solutions” to global warming (“Court takes action on climate-related cases,” March 14).
Let’s talk about what SANDAG can do to cool the planet. Nothing, zilch, nada. If it could remove all humans and all human activity from San Diego County, the Earth’s temperature would not change. So why are special interest groups trying to halt freeway widening projects? To send a message to the rest of the world, they say. The rest of the world has already replied that it will do nothing.
If you want to send a message to the world, use the Internet or an ad in the paper and stop turning our freeways into parking lots.

People should be open to all opinions
I found it ironic that you had a series of commentaries about civility (“Celebrating civility,” March 22) in Sunday’s paper. Then in the letters to the editor you had a letter from an obvious hate monger, (“President doesn’t act like a real patriot”).
Jackie Peacock obviously listens to either right-wing hate radio or Fox News, or more likely both.
When you are fed a constant supply of misinformation, distortion, exaggeration and outright falsehoods, it is no wonder we have a civility problem.
I can only surmise that the acceptance of these views is the result of hearing these distortions repeatedly.
That is the way propaganda worked in communist Russia.

People feel their votes no longer matter
Your editorial (“Phony fixes for voter turnoff,” March 21) neglected to mention what I perceive to be a major cause of apathy.
That is the gerrymandering that the Republican and Democratic parties have done so thoroughly in California.
The result is that the officeholders, state senators and Assembly members are assured re-election until they are termed into the other house. They choose their voters rather than the voters choosing them.
Further, the Democratic Party and its affiliated unions in California control the state to such an extent that voting for any Republican or independent candidate is pointless — a wasted vote.
Nonetheless, I still vote.

STEPPING AWAY FROM QUALCOMM; As tech giant readies to reduce its workforce by 15 percent, local workers must find new options in uncertain job market
The San Diego Union-Tribune
August 16, 2015 Sunday

As Qualcomm readies to cut thousands from its global workforce, what kind of job market will displaced employees find in San Diego if they want to stay here?
The answer is not as clear as you might expect.
Some experts say the job market is healthy. The countywide unemployment rate is just 5 percent. Local employers have added 38,500 jobs so far this year. Qualcomm lures top-tier engineers to San Diego from around the globe. There’s plenty of demand from the region’s defense, medical device and software outfits for technology talent with a Qualcomm pedigree, say experts.
“If you have to lose a job, this is probably one of the best times for it to happen,” said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University. “In technology, engineers are in demand, and they can find jobs in San Diego.”
Other experts. however, say the region’s telecommunications and semiconductor sectors are not what they used to be in terms of employment.
Cricket parent Leap Wireless was sold to AT&T and downsized. Nokia has shrunk its footprint locally after being purchased by Microsoft, shedding 129 workers in July alone. Over in Orange County, Broadcom — where skills of Qualcomm employees might best translate — is in the throes of being purchased by Avago Technologies, a Singapore-based serial acquirer that aims to wring $750 million in annual cost savings out of the deal.
San Diego’s semiconductor/electronic components manufacturing jobs declined from 7,700 workers to 5,200 jobs over the past decade, based on data from the Employment Development Department. Telecommunications employment fell from 15,200 to 8,400 over the same period.
Finding work in technology industries that are hot today in San Diego — predictive analytics, data mining, cyber security, medical devices — may require retraining for workers with expertise in semiconductor design and radio frequency engineering, said experts.
“I think it’s the nature of the modern world that what’s happening at Qualcomm is just going to happen over and over again,” said Mary Walshok, dean of UC San Diego Extension. “So people need to have fundamental skills. But they also need to add to those skills with what we call niche skills. That will allow them to work in a new niche.”
Restructuring
Qualcomm has not released details of its head count reduction. The company employs about 15,000 full time and temporary employees in San Diego County.
On July 22, the wireless chipmaker said it would cut its 31,300 global workforce by 15 percent as part of a move to trim expenses by $1.4 billion.
In an interview, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle characterized the cost cuts as a reboot for Qualcomm after five years of rapid growth.
“We’ve essentially almost doubled the size of the company,” he said. “So I think through a combination of looking at how we were structured when we were half the size versus where we are today — and looking at where the industry itself is — we felt that we were in a position to restructure in a way to take out costs without losing our leadership position.”
Qualcomm has been stung by slower growth in the smartphone market, the loss of a key chip in Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone and rising competition from MediaTek, Intel and others.
Aberle said the restructuring will put the company on a stronger foundation — not only in the maturing smartphone market but also in new business areas such as connected cars, the data center, the Internet of Things and connected medical devices.
“There are very few companies that are as strongly positioned as Qualcomm in the tech industry generally,” he said. “We’re not sitting over here spooked. We actually are very excited.”
Foreign workers
There is a political undercurrent to Qualcomm’s pending workforce cuts. The company has supported immigration reform for highly skilled workers — saying it can’t find enough qualified Americans to meet its needs. Qualcomm has applied for thousands of H-1B temporary work visas for foreign workers over the years, and has received hundreds of approvals.
The company argues that half of U.S. university bachelor’s degree graduates in STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) are not U.S. citizens. If tech companies can’t hire these U.S.-educated foreign graduates to work in this country, the firms will be forced to move their research and innovation centers offshore where they can hire the talent they need.
But during layoffs, these claims of a shortage of American tech workers come under scrutiny.
Southern California Edison and others have taken political heat for laying off American tech workers and replacing them with H-1B workers from outsource information technology providers.
Microsoft was criticized in Congress for calling for more H-1B visas as it was cutting 7,800 jobs.
“Typically, companies hold onto their H-1B workers well after they have let huge numbers of their American workers go,” said Russell Harrison, director of government relations for IEEE USA, a technology industry trade group. “The companies will say, ‘They’re not in the same division. They are not the same type of worker.’ In some cases that is true and in some cases it isn’t.”
Harrison argues H1-B visa rules make it difficult for foreign workers at U.S. companies to change jobs. They tend to be “systemically underpaid” compared with American workers, he said, and if they are laid off, they are supposed to leave the country without recourse.
“There are a lot of financial and business reasons why (companies) would want an H-1B worker over an American,” he said. “The policy question for American society is are workers being treated fairly? What IEEE USA insists is that American workers should not be discriminated against.”
Aberle said Qualcomm and other tech companies are dealing with the pool of workers that’s available. Though the company tries to move existing employees to different jobs within the company when possible, it still needs to hire the best talent for the position, he said. Companies in need
In San Diego, technology experts say data science, software and networking, biomedical engineering, genomics, wearables and cybersecurity are industries hungry for top talent.
The local chapter of IEEE, local universities, UCSD Extension and other groups have support services or training programs in many of these fields.
“I think a lot of folks at Qualcomm, with a little bit of retraining or retooling, will be able to find their footing quite well in other parts of the innovation economy,” said Mark Cafferty, chief executive of San Diego Regional Economic Development Corp.
San Diego has more than 8,000 companies employing 120,000 workers in fields related to software, engineering, scientific research, electronics manufacturing and other technology occupations where laid-off Qualcomm workers might land, according to data complied by the EDC.
Local technology companies continue to say it’s a struggle to find the right kind of tech talent, said Cafferty. Qualcomm is working with the EDC to assist employees affected by upcoming layoffs. EDC will serve as a conduit to connect technology companies in San Diego with impacted Qualcomm employees, according to the company.
“I think a lot of (tech firms) look at Qualcomm and immediately say, the quality of somebody coming out of there is going to be quite high,” said Cafferty. “So if they can get their hands on some of those people and provide a little bit of training, they are probably a lot better off than bringing somebody in who has no experience.”

COMPETITION FOR JOBS FROM FOREIGNERS AS CLOSE AS THE NEXT CUBICLE
The San Diego Union-Tribune
August 23, 2015 Sunday

San Diegans already know full well that foreigners are competing for their jobs. They don’t need national politicians from Donald Trump to Bernie Sanders telling them to worry.
Consider the recent blowback from layoff decisions of two prominent regional companies, Qualcomm and Southern California Edison.
The layoffs highlighted a controversial corner of immigration policy occupied by H-1B visas, which allow companies to hire foreign workers for up to six years in “specialty” occupations such as software, engineering, biotech or even fashion modeling.
Early this year, Edison began displacing about 500 information technology workers, about 100 voluntarily and 400 through layoffs. But their functions were outsourced to Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, two giant firms based in India.
Before they left, some workers were compelled to train their replacements, and some of them were foreign nationals working in the U.S.
The H-1B program “was supposed to be for projects and jobs that American workers could not fill,” one Edison worker told Computerworld, an IT news magazine. “But we’re doing our job. It’s not like they are bringing in these guys for new positions that nobody can fill. Not one of these jobs being filled by India was a job that an Edison employee wasn’t already performing.”
In response, 10 federal lawmakers asked the Department of Labor to investigate whether the H-1B program can be used to directly replace American workers. As of June, that probe was under way, according to Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill.
Indirect replacement is no better, if you’re the one losing a job.
Last month, Qualcomm said it would cut about 15 percent of its global workforce, about 4,700 workers (it employs 15,000 in San Diego; 31,000 worldwide). Executives haven’t released any details, yet the news lit up social media.
“There are large, multistory apartment complexes in Kearny Mesa and Clairemont Mesa full of Qualcomm engineers from India,” said Gail Anderson, a commentator on the Union-Tribune’s digital editions. “I’d say send them all back.”
Hiring amid expansion
Qualcomm, which dominates segments of the smartphone industry, has received about 2,900 H-1B visas since 2009, a period of rapid expansion. Although some are probably renewals of three-year visas — federal agencies don’t break out those numbers — the total works out to 19 percent of the 15,000 people the company hired over the past six years.
Put another way, Anderson is correct, in theory: Qualcomm might reach its domestic layoff target simply by firing guest workers.
However, business reality would seem to rule out the simple approach. As I mentioned, executives aren’t discussing layoff details.
Still, it stands to reason that if H-1B workers were necessary to begin with, arbitrarily firing them would hurt the company. This would hurt the 26,000 or so Qualcomm employees who remain, not to mention shareholders and customers.
It’s a familiar argument. Big tech employers say they struggle to fill highly technical jobs with qualified Americans, so the program is essential to international competitiveness. And losing that competition just sends more jobs overseas.
Tech workers in demand
Led by Microsoft (which recently cut 7,800 jobs), they’ve lobbied Congress to permit far more H-1B visas. Legislation caps tech visas at 85,000 a year, but exemptions for nurses, university researchers and others boost the true annual figure to 120,000 or so.
For perspective, the U.S. has allowed about 1 million immigrants a year over the past decade to legally gain permanent residency. Meanwhile, illegal immigration has been almost nonexistent since 2007, although 11 million unauthorized immigrants still live in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center.
The H-1B program for temporary workers is clearly popular with employers. Federal officials in April received a record 233,000 applications, or nearly four times this year’s tech slots.
Criticism of the program comes from two directions: Many H-1B workers don’t become U.S. citizens, so hiring them ultimately transfers skills to foreign competitors.
Some pay lower wages
Meanwhile, they tend to depress wages. Regulations call for equivalent pay, but employers often use loopholes to pay at the low end of industry scales.
Others sympathize with foreign workers, saying the program amounts to indenturement because the visas belong to employers. Workers who lose jobs generally must leave the country. Such leverage adds potential for abuse.
Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has said that, although some foreign workers are needed, the H-1B and other guest worker programs help business owners with cheap labor at the expense of workers.
“What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy,” Sanders said last month.
In broad terms, this view is shared by Donald Trump, the Republican contender who last week issued a policy paper advocating a temporary halt to all immigration.
On H-1B visas, Trump favors boosting the prevailing wage for foreign workers until employers find it more efficient to hire Americans. He said Republican rival Sen. Marco Rubio’s bid to triple the number of such visas would “decimate women and minorities.”
H-1B joins campaign
Rubio, along with Jeb Bush and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, have called for comprehensive reforms that would provide paths to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. Yet Sanders and Trump, who are drawing crowds and rising in polls, seem to be driving the immigration debate.
In his policy paper, Trump also cited academic research suggesting that U.S. schools are graduating plenty of citizens with degrees in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), but they are having trouble finding jobs. In other words, the ballyhooed STEM shortage is a myth.
Other studies argue the opposite. And rising wages for software engineers suggest tight supply.
Some economists say most Americans would be better off without H-1B visas — if Congress reformed immigration policy to offer residency and eventual citizenship for sharply higher numbers of people, putting skilled workers first in line.
More workers, higher GDP
The Congressional Budget Office reckoned the overhaul that passed the Senate in 2013 (but failed in the House) would have allowed 10 million more immigrants over the next decade, boosting the level of gross domestic product by 3.3 percent.
Canada famously uses a point system that favors people with job offers and advanced degrees. The U.S. sticks to favoring family reunification, and doesn’t focus on skills.
In San Diego, the issue is far from academic. Recent immigrants long ago came to dominate low-wage jobs in hospitality, farming and landscaping. Then they moved into middle-wage jobs in construction and manufacturing.
Now natives increasingly encounter competition from young, hungry recent graduates in professional and technical services, a sector that has added a net 24,300 jobs since 2009 in San Diego County.
And Qualcomm is far from the only local employer using H-1B visas. The list ranges from biotech giant Illumina to Accelrys, a software firm.
Just as certainly, talented foreigners have played key roles in powering economic and technical achievement in San Diego.
Focus on innovation
At Achates Power, a startup that has invented a dramatically cleaner and more-efficient diesel engine, 10 percent of its 50 workers used H-1B visas and about one-third were born abroad, the Union-Tribune reported in 2013.
It’s easy to see why Congress is reluctant to discourage such innovation on U.S. soil. With the American economy gaining strength as the rest of the world slumps, global competition will only grow in ferocity.
Regardless of where talk of national reform ends up, the emotional power of the immigration issue seems unlikely to diminish.
For decades, workers have watched jobs disappear to foreign competitors inside and outside the U.S. And for years, pundits and politicians said boosting skills offered a path to job security.
Reality is more complex. Competition has arrived at the highest skill levels.
Increasingly, workers face the following stark choices: Settle for less money, or work harder and more skillfully than the guy coming for your job — or both.
Or you can wait for politicians to limit trade and immigration in ways that protect more jobs than they destroy. Given the dismal history of such measures, that could be a long wait.

Instead of relying on the false premise of “the economy-boosting history” of the convention center (“A Plan B for convention center,” Sept. 6), how about a Plan C? Invest some millions on previously reported, long-overdue maintenance on the existing center.
More credible studies have repeatedly shown that convention centers (except for possibly Las Vegas and Anaheim) are not money makers, even with a Comic-Con or two.
Let’s take care of what we have before throwing dollars at the next “shiny toy.” Can you say Qualcomm?

Bible clear despite any omissions
Regarding “Jesus did not weigh in on gay marriage issue” (Sept. 10): To address the issue of gay marriage in the Bible and say that just because Jesus did not talk about it, he was not opposed to it is absurd. There were numerous issues that he did not address but to claim that therefore he must be in favor of those issues is illogical and simply untrue.
During the time of Jesus, homosexuality certainly existed but, the actual act of gays marrying one another did not, so there was no need to address it.
The Bible specifically addresses sexual sin, including homosexuality, and those were the issues of the day (and still today), not gays marrying.
The Bible is consistent throughout, marriage is between a man and a woman. Not until very recently has that changed.

Unclear how this city worker was forced out
The story “Ex-city worker runs anti-Semitic website” (Sept. 11) didn’t show full reasons why Escondido forced out the man who worked in the city manager’s office.
As a Jew married to a Holocaust survivor, I believe in free speech, even if it’s hateful and stupid, as long as it doesn’t interfere with one’s work or incite violence.
If stupid, hateful speech were reason for job termination, many politicians would be out of office. The report on the Escondido worker did not cite any way in which his anti-Semitism interfered with his work. Is there more to the story?

American men facing growing challenge
I was sad to read the U-T’s “The vanishing male worker” (Sept. 6), particularly where it says that a male high school graduate has “almost nothing an employer is going to value.”
In San Diego I see many workers in construction, roofing and landscaping, good jobs for high school graduates, all taken by Mexican nationals.
So our immigration policy of nonenforcement is obviously hurting American men looking for jobs, by flooding the labor market and depressing wages.
Then, when a man studies hard to get his engineering degree, he’ll find that local tech companies are preferentially hiring low-paid foreign engineers with H1B visas. All in the name of “the economy,” but what value is a “good” economy if American men are not able to participate in it?

Hot weather brings concern for kids
We pour billions at the drop of hat to go to war, or rebuild Iraq or support Israel or give massive tax breaks to the rich, yet we don’t have air conditioning for children in many schools?
Why is there an uproar about taxes but not for a lack of air conditioning for children or big class sizes?
Why do we build a fancy library downtown when the places children spend the most time don’t have air conditioning?
I cannot help but think, given our actions and votes, that we deserve to suffer without wonder.

Motorcycle noise mars nice vacation
We have just completed a two-month visit to Carlsbad, staying in an apartment across from Tamarack Beach.
The area has so many attractions, leading with the glorious ocean, wonderful restaurants, theater offerings, friendly people and was perfect, with one exception.
That is, the excruciating noise coming from motorcycles. I empathize with the complaints about noise around the airport.
However, this noise is essential to the functioning of the planes.
I cannot imagine any purpose to the sounds coming from motorcycles other than boosting the egos of the drivers.
Is there nothing that can be done to curb this public nuisance?
You have a piece of paradise, do whatever is necessary to make it perfect.

Women in combat roles is complicated

Section: Opinion; Pg. B-8
Length: 843 words
Body


Regarding “Equal opportunity for all military jobs” (Sept. 28): The mission of Marine Corps infantry is to close with and destroy the enemy. That is a cold, brutal fact.
Arguments that women should join those units ignore a basic question: Will those units become more or less combat effective? Thousands of years of human history suggest the answer is “less.” Those who unequivocally champion equal opportunity for women should understand that combat is an unforgiving laboratory for implementing social change.
How does the U-T propose that society respond to women who are capable of serving in close combat units but don’t want to? If it believes they should be given a choice, it should then answer this: How level is a playing field that allows one gender to choose, but not the other?

It is not ignorance for us to distrust Iran
Lee Galloway’s letter (“Opinions should be based on the facts,” Sept. 28) implies those opposed to Obama’s (et al.) agreement with Iran regarding its nuclear program are ignorant.
Perhaps he should consult the most vehement of the ignorant, the Israelis, who, at the zenith of their “ignorance,” bombed Saddam Hussein’s nuclear installation at Osirik, Iraq, and the North Korean/Syrian nuclear project in Syria, thereby preventing both from acquiring nuclear weapons.
A largely ignorant world howled and decried the pesky Israelis for meddling in another country’s affairs on both occasions while pragmatists far and wide breathed a collective sigh of relief. No informed person should be surprised if it happens again.

Time to rethink the H-1B visa program
It was a coincidence that a front-page article “H-1B visas may be sending U.S. jobs abroad” (Sept. 30) focused on H-1B visas.
This program was enacted to bring in foreigners to take technical jobs in American companies. Supposedly, there was a shortage of skilled technical professionals in the United States.
Coincidently, this morning I got an email from an “agency” offering H-1B software developers for $399 per week. That’s $9.97 per hour for jobs that Americans got around $40 per hour for, plus benefits.
Tech jobs require constant education to stay up to date. Before H-1B, companies would pay to train tech workers. Now, they get “cheap” H-1B workers then dump them for new H-1B workers when their knowledge becomes as obsolete as the Americans they originally replaced.

Effort to bash honey politically motivated
Peter Whoriskey’s article “Research finds that honey is no healthier than corn sweetener” (Sept. 13) is grossly misleading and distorts research findings.
Susan Raatz, lead researcher, agreed. Her study found neither honey, sugar nor high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) affected blood sugar or insulin levels. No other health benefits were tested.
USDA and the National Honey Board (USDA appointed) provided funding. The underlying motivation for misrepresenting results is an attempt to de-vilify HFCS.
USDA spends $9 billion annually subsidizing corn. Amid health concerns, HFCS sales plunged, giving the corn industry tremendous incentive to resurrect HFCS.
Whoriskey implies HFCS is as healthy as honey. That’s a sensationalist supposition, one the research does not support.

Pope could afford to take in some refugees
Regarding “Pope asks Congress to embrace migrants” (Sept. 25): The United States has always been a country that embraces immigrants – legal immigrants, that is.
As a Catholic and a Hispanic, I know that the church has always promoted the respect to the rule of law and doing the right things, therefor, I do not agree with the notion that now we should make an exception and embrace those who broke our laws coming illegally and reward them with American legal residency first and citizenship later.
I have seen the opulence of the Vatican, so if he wants to embrace the illegals, he should take them there.

Floating a solution for seal, sea lion issues
It is time to construct an island near shore in La Jolla for the seals and sightseers, near where “seal rock” is now?
The rocks on the shore are their current habitat, and they stink up the neighborhood and restaurants. The island could simulate the rocks and bedding down locations.
Their fish meals probably will take refuge under the island. Tourists, locals and the restaurants would appreciate and enjoy it.

The front-page headline of the U-T read “Nuclear waste burial set at San Onofre site” (Oct. 7). San Onofre is 60 miles north of downtown San Diego.

I am responding to the letter to the editor (“Time to rethink the H1-B visa program,” Oct. 3) about the reader who had received an email offering the services of software professionals for $399 pre week or $10 an hour.
We all know what is going on. The abuse of the H1B visa program is rampant. This is an outrage.
I could not with a straight face tell a young person to spend five years in school studying to be an engineer or a computer scientist. I could not tell them to take on massive education debt.
I might suggest they consider being a mall guard for $10 an hour. They would be way ahead of the game.

We can’t be sure TPP protects our interests
Regarding “Pacific trade accord deserves support” (Oct. 6): The U-T’s levelheaded approach rarely fails, but it seems to have been left outside in the rain on this one.
The editorial praising passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership was missing one key item – a review of the actual content of the accord.
Why? Because we’re not allowed to see it.

More work to be done on premature birth
Regarding “Premature good news long awaited” (Oct. 3): As a mom to a 29-week preemie hospitalized for seven months in a neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU), these statistics are encouraging.
However, a 47 percent survival rate without major illness for 27-weekers unfortunately means 53 percent remain with complications, including colostomies, tracheotomies and brain damage. Up to half of premature births have unknown causes.
The NICU surrounds families with sickness, despair and even death, leaving few unscathed. The turmoil experienced by families can linger in forms of depression, PTSD, medical bankruptcy and divorce.
The physiological and psychological fallouts of prematurity can be lifelong, sometimes with devastating consequences.
Let’s keep advancing research so all families can enjoy beautiful homecomings.

Liberal hedonism is a danger to society
The tragedy of the latest liberal miscalculation (“Governor was right to sign aid-in-dying bill,” Oct. 6) is that now liberals kill you at the beginning with abortion and at the end with assisted suicide.
These hedonists will soon only want those with perfect health between some designated ages to be granted life.
Be very, very careful Union-Tribune and L.A. Times what you endorse, for this is a slippery slope to cultural demise.
You may believe your “thinking has evolved,” but it’s really just degenerated into gratuitous egotism and moral perversion.

Cruz/Kasich vs. Trump? Good!

Cruz/Kasich vs. Trump? Good!
Three weeks ago, it appeared that Donald Trump's presidential campaign had peaked, and the chances seemed strong that a brokered Republican national convention would choose another person as a nominee after no candidate secured the necessary 1,237 delegates on the first ballot. Since then, Trump has moderated his rhetoric and promoted the idea that long-established rules on how states picked delegates were "rigged" against him by a desperate GOP establishment - and started to gain new momentum in the polls.
This is a cause for despair. The possibility that one of America's two major political parties might nominate someone who has said so many scary, conflicting, ugly things is testament to how disaffected millions of Americans are. But it's also a testament to a cult-of-personality politics that is indistinguishable from mass superficiality. Trump has yet to give an in-depth interview in which he displays coherent views on national security, foreign policy, diplomacy or trade, something Politico reported recently that a range of world leaders find terrifying. What's striking is that Trump isn't even consistent in his incoherence; last month, he changed his position on H-1B visas for skilled workers three times in one day.
That is why we welcome the Sunday revelation that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the two other Republican candidates, will work together to try to deny Trump the nomination. Desperate times require unusual strategies. 
How desperate? It only seems to have sunk in with GOP leaders - not the rank and file - that the stakes are far greater than winning the White House. In the short term, 24 of the 34 Senate seats up for election this fall are held by Republicans, thanks to the 2010 GOP landslide. Having Trump as the nominee is a recipe for down-ticket disaster. But if sticking it to the American status quo is so important to Republican voters that they don't care about losing the White House and the Senate, then their choice is clear.

Highlight: Congressman Darrell Issa visits San Diego startup The Control Group.Skyler Westby The Control Group
Body


A congressman walks into bar ... 
Well, technically, a brewery. And it was on official D.C. business, as Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, toured a variety of area upstarts as part of Startup Day Across America.
Now in its fourth year, the day pairs elected officials with startups in the communities they represent. For Issa, who helps run the national event, it's not so much an opportunity to visit young companies, which he claims to do frequently, but a means of nudging his colleagues to be more involved in their own local startup communities. 
Perhaps more importantly, Startup Day is designed to give the little guys a seat at the table with folks who often have legislative control over economic matters that can make or break their fledgling companies.
"Being with startups is something that has value," said Issa, who represents California's 49th District. "And if every member of Congress visited at least one startup, once a year, we would come with common knowledge that would allow us to do legislation better."
Issa practiced what he preached when visiting with three San Diego startups on Thursday. Each stop was themed around a topic related to government's help or hindrance of businesses. 
At The Control Group, a 4-year-old web development shop that runs the consumer-facing background-check site Instant Checkmate, the talking point was H1B visas, a controversial program that grants a limited number of non-immigrant visas so that U.S. companies can hire foreign workers in specialty positions, say engineering jobs. The 76-person startup currently employs one H1B visa worker but lost out on another H1B hire due to the program's lottery system.
"Indian consulting firms took those slots," Issa explained. "About half of the slots go to employees making about $65,000 a year that work for these so-called consulting companies."
While sipping cold-brew coffee on draft at the spunky office, the congressman lamented that some firms are gaming the system by hiring coders for cheap instead of bringing over higher-skilled workers, as the program intends. He said that he was attempting to close this "loophole." 
Later at Airbitz, Issa saw first-hand the upside of advocating for legislation that allows startups to raise equity funding from regular people - and not just accredited investors.
Five-person Airbitz makes software that other companies can use in their apps to encrypt and secure consumer data. Started in early 2014, Airbitz initially raised $475,000 going the traditional venture capital route. The company's next raise (about $1 million), however, will come from its users, as it plans to take advantage of newly enacted Title III of the JOBS Act to sell equity stakes to anyone who wants a small piece of the company.
Finally, at the family-owned Belching Beaver Brewery location in Vista, Issa sampled a few of the craft brewer's singular offerings and explained that he supports beer tax reform. Currently, a proposed bill, co-sponsored by Issa, aims to cut the federal government's excise tax rate, which taxes the production of beer (before it's sold to consumers).
"We're trying to get that reduced or eliminated," Issa said, who refers to the tax as a "hidden" tax that unfairly penalizes microbreweries. "There's no logic to it. These excise taxes are a legacy tax."
Belching Beaver's CEO Tom Vogel estimates that his nearly 4-year-old company pays roughly $9,000 a month in excise taxes.
Fair or unfair, one Issa platitude seemed to rule the day: "There are times in which your government is the problem and not the solution."

Highlight: Members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers picket in Irvine amid layoffs last year by Southern California Edison. Rep. Darrell Issa's bill targeting H-1B visa applications would remove the master's degree exemption and increase the salary exemption to $100,000 annually.Mark Boster Los Angeles Times ZACH GIBSON NEW YORK TIMES
Body


Companies that depend on H-1B visas for a substantial part of their workforce may have a tougher time hiring more, as Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, has introduced legislation to restrict loopholes in their application process. 
His proposal comes after Southern California Edison laid off about 400 employees in early 2015 and brought in workers through consulting companies. Those consulting companies are heavy users of H-1B visas to obtain employees, reportedly at salaries that undercut those of American workers.
"It was pretty easy to see that wasn't the intent of H-1B, which is to make up for shortage when you cannot find enough labor at any price," Issa said in an interview.
Edison said in a statement at the time of the layoffs that it was "not hiring H-1B workers to replace displaced employees. Any H-1B visa workers SCE does hire for its own workforce are paid a wage comparable to SCE's domestic workforce."
Companies that have a certain proportion of H-1B employees, 15 percent or higher for companies with more than 50 employees, have to submit paperwork with H-1B applications showing they advertised the job to American workers, and considered their applications. Currently, employers can be exempted from that paperwork if the potential employee holds a master's degree or is paid at least $60,000 annually.
The H-1B visa program allows workers to come to the United States in a temporary, non-immigrant status. The visa lasts for three years with the option to renew for another three. While in the U.S., H-1B visa holders can apply for green cards.
Issa's bill would remove the master's degree exemption and increase the salary exemption to $100,000 annually.
Issa's bill has bipartisan support, including backing from the San Diego delegation in Congress - Democrats Scott Peters, Juan Vargas and Susan Davis and Republican Duncan Hunter.
Almost 4,300 people were certified to work in San Diego on H-1B visas in 2015, according to data from the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corp. The data does not specify the workers' nationalities.
About 8 percent, or 337 people, were paid salaries under the $60,000 exemption. Close to 64 percent, or 2,735 people, were paid less than $100,000.
The lowest annual salary, at $22,000, was for a master teacher at Park's Global Martial Arts Inc. The highest salary, at $400,000, was for a model at No Ties Management LLC.
Of the 948 companies that obtained certifications for H-1B visas for San Diego area employees in 2015, Qualcomm Technologies Inc had the most at 953 employees with an average annual salary of $102,095. The next highest company, Tata Consultancy Services Limited, which was one of the consulting groups involved in the Edison controversy, had 103 employees certified for H-1B visas with an average annual salary of $74,559. 
A representative for Tata, Benjamin Trounson, declined to comment for this story.
"We don't engage in industry speculation, so there isn't anything for us to offer on this topic at this stage," Trounson said.
Qualcomm did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication about whether it would be affected by the changes.
Matt Rifat, president of Alcala Labs, said that the one employee hired through an H-1B visa for the company last year is an H-1B success story. He said Alcala recruited for 18 months for a geneticist, and, after finding no one, pursued and hired an Austrian in 2015.
After coming to the U.S., the geneticist fell in love and married an American woman. He continues to work for Alcala and is applying to adjust his status.
"For the scientific and biotech community, it's really valuable, and, in my experience, it's not being abused," Rifat said of the H-1B visa program. "Had an American shown up with those qualifications, we would've hired them."
Issa said that the changes would actually help the biotech community because the U.S. only allocates 85,000 H-1B visas per year. Those visas are assigned through lottery.
"Every year, in a matter of hours, we oversubscribe beyond the entire 85,000 slots plus," Issa said. "There's no question that if you were to take the best and the brightest, most highly needed, most highly compensated, you wouldn't do it by lottery, and yet lottery is how it's done."
Issa said he hopes to make further H-1B reforms but that this legislation was what seemed doable in the current legislative climate.

Worker visa reform plan needs fixes

Hooray! During an era of partisan gridlock, in the middle of a contentious political campaign, members of both parties led by two congressmen from San Diego County have agreed that it's time to fix the broken system for granting visas used by temporary guest workers at U.S. high-tech companies. However, this fix introduced by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, and Rep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, just doesn't go far enough.
Under the H-1B visa program, it's perfectly legal for a U.S. company to lay off a U.S. worker and give her or his job to a replacement from overseas - so long as the job is a "specialty occupation" with a salary of more than $60,000 a year.
"Specialty occupations" are typically those requiring a bachelor's degree or more advanced education in fields such as architecture, engineering, information technology (IT) and medicine. Many of these jobs pay U.S. workers average salaries more than $60,000. Under current law, it's a bargain and completely legal for U.S. companies to lay off their domestic workforce and import cheaper temporary workers from abroad. 
And that evil bargain is exactly what happened last year to high-tech workers in Florida and here in California. In January 2015, Disney laid off some 250 IT workers from its offices in Orlando. In February 2015, Southern California Edison (SoCal) laid off 400 tech workers. In both instances skilled, experienced U.S. workers were replaced by foreign guest workers with H-1B visas, employed by global outsourcing firms that specialize in providing low-cost labor to multinational companies. 
In addition to losing their jobs, Disney and SoCal employees suffered the indignity of being forced to train their replacements. 
Responding to these and other H1-B abuses, Rep. Issa and Rep. Peters have introduced legislation to reform the program. The "Protect and Grow American Jobs Act" would raise the threshold for a specialty occupation to $100,000. The bipartisan reform legislation also would eliminate an exemption that allows employers to replace U.S. workers with these replacement visa holders if the position requires a master's degree. 
As the president of a union representing 75,000 rocket scientists, Boeing engineers and others employed in high-tech fields throughout the United States - including a number of H1-B visa holders - I'm glad to see Rep. Issa and his colleagues recognize that the current program is deeply flawed but disappointed that their bill does so little.
Raising the salary threshold to $100,000 before an American worker can be replaced is a step in the right direction. But it's still lower than base pay for many U.S. workers with specific technical expertise - so companies can and will still cut costs by laying off U.S. workers in favor of H1-B visa holders.
A better idea is one proposed by Sen. Charles Grassley. R-Iowa, that would provide for enhanced investigations and tougher penalties for those who abuse the program. Better yet would be for Congress to create a mechanism to link H1-B visas to actual shortages in the labor market.
Former workers at Disney and SoCal Edison are understandably angry that their own government runs a program that gave their former employers an incentive to take away their jobs. 
H1-B visas can be a threat to U.S. workers and at the same time not a walk in the park for the workers that come in under the work program. The employer, not the worker, holds the visa - which means these skilled workers from other countries live and work in the U.S. as indentured servants. They're frozen in place and legally barred from working for any other company. If an H1-B visa holder is underpaid or otherwise mistreated, he or she is unlikely to complain, for fear of losing his or her ability to work in this country. 
That's the wrong way to welcome new workers to America. H1-B visa holders should hold their own visas and have the right to change jobs so they are not subject to the whims of a cost-cutting or abusive employer. 
America is a nation built by workers and families from here and all over the globe. The H1-B program can be part of that great tradition - if it is reformed to include greater protections for both U.S. and temporary workers from abroad.

Issa's H-1B visa bill delayed in committee

Body


A bill intended to close loopholes in the H-1B visa program, introduced by Rep. Darrell Issa and co-sponsored by the rest of the San Diego delegation, is facing opposition, and a committee vote has been delayed. 
The Protect and Grow American Jobs Act, as the bill is known, was touted for its bipartisan support. It was supposed to go to vote in the Judiciary Committee this week but did not. Calvin Moore, a spokesman for Issa, said the vote was pushed back and the bill will continue to move forward. 
"These types of changes to the schedule are routine and happen all the time," Moore said via email. He said a new vote has not yet been scheduled.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, said the bill was pulled last minute without explanation. She is a committee member and opposes the bill.
Lofgren said she doesn't think the bill has enough support or time to pass before the end of session. While she agrees that the H-1B program needs reforms to block abuse from companies that use it to hire foreign workers at lower wages than their American counterparts, she doesn't think Issa's bill is the way to do it.
"I don't think it does anything, and in fact in some ways it could make it worse, at least for Silicon Valley," Lofgren said by telephone. 
Congress does not have much time left before the end of the session. At the end of September, it will recess until after election day. If the bill does not pass before the end of the session, it will be automatically dead.
The bill would adjust application requirement exemptions for companies that are "H-1B dependent." For companies with more than 50 employees, that means at least 15 percent of its workforce is made up of H-1B holders.
Employers can use H-1B visas to bring in foreign workers on a temporary, non-immigrant status for three years. The visa is renewable for an additional three years.
H-1B dependent employers have to submit paperwork proving that they attempted to find American workers and were unable to fill their labor needs through the American workforce.
Those employers are currently exempt from that process if the potential H-1B hire will earn at least $60,000 annually or has a master's degree. Issa's bill would raise the salary exemption to $100,000 annually and remove the master's degree exemption.
The bill was crafted after Southern California Edison laid off several hundred employees in early 2015 and contracted workers through consulting firms that hire heavily through the H-1B visa program. Edison said in a statement at the time of the layoffs that it was "not hiring H-1B workers to replace displaced employees." 
Similar layoff controversies were reported in 2015 at Disney - which later changed its mind about the layoffs - and recently at the University of California San Francisco.
Lofgren said raising the salary to $100,000 would concentrate companies that abuse the program in higher wage areas where $100,000 would still undercut American wages.
She said she would rather see changes to the way the visas are allocated. They are currently issued via lottery, and there are many more applications than available visas each year. She wants to give the visas to the companies willing to pay the highest salaries.
"You would end up getting the high-skill people that the visa was intended to do, and you would also avoid undercutting American workers," Lofgren said.
Moore maintained that the bill still has plenty of support in Congress. He said two congressmen, Republicans Ken Calvert of Riverside County and Raúl Labrador of Idaho, recently joined the bill's list of co-sponsors. 
"Of course there's more we'd like to have included in the bill, and there's more we'd like to get done, but doing nothing is not an option. This is a meaningful and common-sense change, and saying otherwise is simply indefensible," Moore said. "The bill does what everyone has agreed needs to happen as a starting place for reform: raising the exemption level to a salary more in-line with today's workforce and indexing it for inflation.
"If we're being perfectly honest, the only way this bill would make outsourcing worse is if we fail to pass it and do nothing, which is what it looks like Zoe would prefer," Moore added.
The bill has also received opposition from the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations and the Department for Professional Employees.
"If your business is simply to import foreign workers, that just can't be right," said Greg Junemann, president of the engineers federation. "Congressman Issa's bill says you can do all of that as long as you pay people higher than you're paying now. It doesn't do nearly enough."
Two industry trade associations, including the Consumer Technology Association and Compete America, voiced support of the bill
According to a representative for the Consumer Technology Association, support for the bill hasn't wavered as questions have arisen concerning its ability to pass.
"Reps. Issa and (Scott) Peters' simple, bipartisan bill protects the integrity of our H-1B system and protects against abuse of the program, so American companies can attract the world's best talent - and our country can more fully enjoy the life-changing benefits our innovation economy offers," the organization said in a statement.

Issa renews local focus in campaign

Rep. Darrell Issa, the Republican stalwart and government watchdog, admits like so many others that 2016 is not a typical election.
The Vista congressman who rose to national recognition as the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has cruised to re-election seven times, but this fall he's back in his suburban San Diego district in a fight to get voters to elect him to a ninth term in the House.
For a congressman who has easily won a new term ever since he entered office, this is a different race.
"I haven't had a yard sign in 16 years. And you know, there are people that are calling and getting yard signs. And we're going to try and run a more conventional" campaign, he said in a recent interview with the Union-Tribune editorial board and reporters. "Why does Darrell Issa deserve another two years to try to accomplish things in Washington?"
Issa is spending more time in the district, shaking hands, hosting town hall meetings and touring businesses.
"I've talked to Darrell more in the last month than I have in the last 10 years," said Oceanside City Councilman Jerry Kern, a Republican. "Darrell is highly engaged in the district stuff. ... For the most part, Darrell was engaged on the national stage, but now he's rolling up his sleeves and getting into the down-home politics."
Much of the credit or blame for Issa's situation goes to Doug Applegate. A retired Marine colonel turned trial lawyer, the Democratic challenger surprised both major parties when he finished with 45.5 percent of the vote in the June primary to the incumbent's 50.8 percent. Ryan Wingo, a liberal independent candidate, received 3.7 percent. Applegate was outspent 16-to-1 and came into the contest with no political experience on his résumé or much name recognition.
Kern, as well as Francine Busby, the head of the county Democratic Party, said that Applegate's strength in the primary might be the result of the presidential race. When polls opened, it was already clear that Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee, while there was still a contested race between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic contest, giving Democrats the greater incentive to vote.
In many ways, Applegate is like other opponents Issa has handily defeated. He entered the race with little name recognition or money and a party registration disadvantage. Democrats represent 31.3 percent voters in the 49th District, with Republicans at 39.5 percent. An additional 24.3 percent do not belong to a political party. While it's a solidly red district, it's also the smallest GOP advantage Issa has had since entering office.
"Well, I might have the toughest circumstances," Issa said of this year's election.
But Issa's record in office and political decisions make this year different, Busby said. A part of what sets this election apart is Issa's support for Trump, a candidate that Democratic polling shows is unpopular. Another component, she said, is Issa's efforts to investigate the Obama administration.
"I think that nationally, the fact that Issa led these witch-hunt hearings, with the IRS, the Fast and Furious with the attorney general, Hillary Clinton and Benghazi, Sandra Fluke and reproductive rights, he's paying a price for going to war on people and issues and spending taxpayer money and vilifying innocent people," Busby said.
She said Issa is "disliked intensely" by Democrats across the country. "They don't even know who (Applegate) is. They're anti-Issa," she added.
But Applegate might not be a good fit for the district and is "seeking to impose liberal San Francisco values on North County voters," county Republican Party Chairman Tony Krvaric said.
Issa said his image as a Republican attack dog who never tires of taking on the Obama administration was off the mark, saying he was just as aggressive with President George W. Bush. Issa said his committee was critical of the dysfunction of the federal Minerals Management Service under Bush after the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the $700 billion bank bailout initiative known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
"I've always been willing to take on my own party or the other party," Issa told the Los Angeles Times. "Congress is not supposed to be a lap dog for the administration."
Issa has built his political career on national issues, through both legislation and his influence on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. In an August interview, he said he entered office in 2001 with plans for patent and immigration reforms. 
He points out that researchers have ranked him one of the most effective lawmakers in the House; professors at the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University say he's the second-most-effective Republican in the chamber.
But his most recent efforts have been more parochial. With less than two months before the general election, Issa is adding a piece of home to his profile. Since the primary he has toured an Oceanside gas station convenience store to get firsthand knowledge of concerns facing those small businesses. He even manned the cash register for a spell.
He toured two Marine Corps installations with two Southern California Democrats, and an Ohio Republican House member and made a rare appearance before local press in the process.
Earlier this year he introduced legislation that would make it tougher for companies to hire some of their employees through H-1B visas. It's a bill he introduced after Southern California Edison fired 400 workers last year and replaced them through consulting companies that relied heavily on the visas to build their workforce while paying wages lower than what American workers typically earn.
He toured three startups in his district, including a brewery.
He's held town hall meetings on so-called sober living homes that have popped up in Orange and San Diego counties, and on Tuesday he introduced legislation that would change federal law to let state and local governments address these residences. In a matter of days it earned the support of the San Clemente City Council.
"The bill we've introduced today will permit state and local governments to implement reasonable oversight of sober living facilities and ensure that those who need help are able to get it in a safe, secure environment," he said in a statement.
But Issa cautioned that he doesn't consider it a congressman's job to deal with all granular local issues.
"When I ran for office, it was about a 15-way race, but I had one major opponent ... a state senator. I made a lot to do about the fact that you don't hire a congressman to be your pothole fixer. And I still stick by that," he said in an interview.
Applegate said he's going to pay more attention to the issues in the district, and its industries and institutions.
"I don't think anybody has been honest about what the real problems are" in the district, he said. "... And somebody that's been there 16 years should have gotten something done other than a hearing on Benghazi, the Cincinnati IRS, Fast and Furious and a short special committee and house oversight over women's reproductive health rights ... where four or five clerics of different religions came to testify. And a woman was denied that opportunity to testify."
Applegate recently had to respond to news reports that he was accused of harassing, stalking and threatening his former wife. The Democrat blamed Republicans for what he called dirty politics.
About 75 percent of the 49th District is in San Diego County and covers Oceanside, Carlsbad, Del Mar, along with San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano in Orange County.
The results of the general election are likely to determine whether Issa maintains his newfound focus on the district, Oceanside Councilman Kern said. If it's a close race, he'll keep his election-season strategy, but will probably return to the national stage if he wins in a landslide.
Kern said he appreciates Issa's focus on the district.
"When you have a little competition, it makes you sharper," Kern he said.

Melania Trump worked in U.S. without a visa

Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States that occurred before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to documents from 20 years ago provided to The Associated Press. 
The details of Mrs. Trump's early paid modeling work in the U.S. emerged in the final days of a bitter presidential campaign in which her husband, Donald Trump, has taken a hard line on immigration laws and those who violate them. Trump has proposed broader use of the government's E-verify system allowing employers to check whether job applicants are authorized to work. 
Mrs. Trump, who received a green card in March 2001 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006, has always maintained that she arrived in the country legally and never violated the terms of her immigration status. 
The wife of the GOP presidential nominee has said through an attorney that she first came to the U.S. from Slovenia on Aug. 27, 1996, on what's known as a B1/B2 visitor visa and then obtained an H-1B work visa on Oct. 18, 1996. 
The documents obtained by the AP show she was compensated for the modeling jobs that she worked between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15 of that year, altogether worth $20,056. During this time, her visa allowed her generally to be in the U.S. and look for work, but not perform paid work. The documents consist of detailed accounting ledgers, her contract and related papers.
It is highly unlikely the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump. The government can seek to revoke the U.S. citizenship of immigrants after the fact in cases when it determines a person willfully misrepresented or concealed facts relevant to his naturalization. But it effectively does this in only the most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes.

A $6 million federal grant will be used to train local workers for high-skill jobs in industries that typically rely on foreign labor. 
The America's Promise grant from the Department of Labor will fund workforce development programs focused on getting workers who face career barriers - such as veterans, Native Americans, ex-offenders - into advanced manufacturing and emerging technology jobs usually filled by H-1B visa holders.
The five colleges and learning centers participating are:
\x95 Grossmont College
\x95 Cuyamaca College
\x95 Technology Career Institute at MiraCosta College
\x95 Chaffey College InTech Center
\x95 GEAR UP (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs).
They will work in partnership with:
\x95 San Diego Maritime Alliance
\x95 Advanced Manufacturing Partnership for Southern California
\x95 National Tool & Machining Association
\x95 California Steel Industries
\x95 Manufacturers' Council of the Inland Empire.
The training programs will focus on robotics, marine engineering or "blue tech," drone technology, biomedical equipment repair, cybersecurity and computer technology.
Tuition and fees not paid for by financial aid, such as Pell grants and fee waivers, will be covered by the grant funds, Grossmont-Cuyamaca district officials said.
"This grant will help us transform what we do as community colleges by creating high-wage, high-demand opportunities that target underserved populations," said Javier Ayala, dean of career and technical education and workforce development at Grossmont College.
There are numerous job opportunities here, the college district said, as California has the second largest number of H-1B certifications of any state.
"We believe that leveraging the experience of multiple colleges and the power of our industry partners will result in highly effective training for our students, who will be qualified for high-paying jobs in our community," said Sally Cox, executive director of the Foundation for Grossmont & Cuyamaca Colleges.
The college district said it will use its grant money to give a boost to its corresponding programs, such as robotics and information technology, and develop a drone technology program. 
The grant is part of more than $111 million awarded to 23 colleges, universities and workforce partnerships across the country.
MiraCosta College, the grant's fiscal agent, will oversee how the money is spent.

Body


Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, wants companies that recruit highly skilled foreign workers to follow new standards aimed at making it more difficult to exploit the visa program that allows them to work in the U.S.
Issa on Wednesday introduced legislation backed by multiple Democrats and Republicans that changes the requirements for the visa program known as H-1B, which was designed so foreign workers with specialty skills can fill jobs in the U.S. when qualified Americans aren't available.
The program is heavily used by technology companies, particularly in Silicon Valley, but Issa said the spirit of the program has been ignored by companies that replace Americans with workers from other countries whom they can pay less.
"As soon as you have examples of Americans losing jobs, it makes a good program look bad," Issa said. "You have great success stories, but you don't get judged based on your success stories. You get judged on your failures."
He pointed to Southern California Edison, which has been criticized in recent years for laying off Americans and hiring foreign workers through a consulting company.
"It's specifically required that there be a shortage," Issa said. "When Southern California Edison asked their employees being laid off to train their replacements, by definition there was not a shortage."
Edison said at the time of the layoffs that it was "not hiring H-1B workers to replace displaced employees. Any H-1B visa workers SCE does hire for its own workforce are paid a wage comparable to SCE's domestic workforce."
Disney and a handful of other California companies have been criticized in recent years for similar moves.
Only 85,000 H-1B visas are granted each year. Critics complain that U.S. employers exploit loopholes in the system to hire cheaper labor from abroad at the expense of American workers.
Companies with more than 50 employees who have 15 percent or more employees with the visas must show on H-1B applications that the job was advertised to American workers. But employers can be exempted from that paperwork if the potential employee holds a master's degree or will be paid at least $60,000 annually.
Issa's bill would remove the exemption for workers with a master's degree; he says it's too easy to get one from an uncredentialed foreign university. The bill would also increase the minimum salary needed for an exemption to $100,000 annually.
Issa pitched a similar bill late in the last Congress, when few new bills were considered , and it died in committee without a hearing. But with a new Republican president this year, things could be different.
Reforming the program was among the topics discussed at a December meeting between Trump and tech leaders. Issa said conversations with tech leaders after that meeting, coupled with bipartisan support for the legislation, makes him think the bill has a better chance in this Congress.
"I expect it to move, and move quickly," Issa said. "This is a piece of legislation which logically should get an overwhelming majority in the House on a bipartisan basis. It's designed to be an ... easy win."
Issa said he's hoping the H-1B program changes can be considered outside of broader immigration reform "so we just fix a problem."
"If we can't solve this one on a bipartisan basis, we're not going to get to the harder ones," he said.

Donald Trump's victory proved that most everything the pundits, reporters and the political class thought they knew was wrong. It turned years of political orthodoxy on its head, and, in its aftermath, left the political world looking for explanations for what happened and lessons to guide the future.
In the midst of it all, my great concern is that Republicans will misunderstand the most profound of these lessons and ignore the clear message voters sent us: that Washington needs to listen more, talk less and renew its focus on actually getting things done.
After all, Donald Trump didn't campaign as a traditional Republican, and certainly did not confine his platform to a conventionally conservative ideology. Instead, he appealed to many Americans' frustration, offering a simple promise to cut good deals and get things done for the better of our country. Restoring that singular focus on producing results is wise advice that all politicians - Republicans and Democrats alike - should take to heart sooner rather than later.
Americans have spent years seeing politician after politician go through atmospheric rises - the reward for lofty talk and lavish campaign promises - only to become disappointed when these leaders later failed to deliver. 
For too long, Americans have spoken up only to have their voices fall on the deaf ears of a system more interested in one-upmanship than advancing the priorities at home. Just look at the past few years.
Americans wanted to lower the costs of health care. Instead, they got mandates that have made insurance even more expensive. Americans wanted good-paying jobs. Instead, they got misguided policies that sent jobs overseas. Americans wanted a VA that honored those who wore the uniform of our nation. Instead, they got a system that hasn't come close to delivering veterans the care or services they deserve. 
Whether you think we're "Stronger Together" or need to "Drain The Swamp," we should all agree that America would benefit from putting American jobs first, safeguarding our energy future and restoring affordability to health care. 
Congress should work with President Trump to fix problems in our H1B visa program that have allowed outsourcing companies to lay off droves of American workers. Putting an end to these abuses should be a major priority for the new administration, and is probably one of the biggest opportunities for lasting consensus in the new Congress. 
Here locally, we should work with the administration to advance creative solutions - like the Interim Consolidated Storage Act - which would allow us to begin removing nuclear waste from the shuttered San Onofe facility in as little as just five years.
But we also need to work together to fix where Obamacare went wrong. Together, we must repeal and replace Obamacare with a system that actually reduces the cost of care, without new mandates, taxes or the same one-size-fits all solutions.
If the election results from this November can confirm anything at all, it's that Americans have grown tired of politics as usual. They want leaders who will lead boldly and, more importantly, actually listen to the people who sent them there.
It would be a serious error for anyone in Washington to interpret the election as a license to advance a purely partisan agenda and ignore real opportunities to work together and achieve consensus. 
This was the historic mistake of the early Obama administration that interpreted its wins as carte blanche approval for a "go it alone" strategy. It rammed through Obamacare without a single Republican vote and later paid a heavy price for its political hubris. 
By the end of the Obama presidency, the Democrats lost more than 1,000 offices including congressional and state legislative seats, governorships and, eventually, the White House. 
Republicans would be wise, for the country's sake, to stop this history from repeating itself.
That's why I've made it my priority to continue reaching across the aisle and seeking new partnerships to advance new solutions to the issues we so desperately need to address. Working together, we'll reset Washington's focus back to where it belongs: on your concerns, your ideas, and the issues most important to you. 
The next few years will have their own new challenges and new opportunities, but together can - and will - make good on the promise of responsive Washington that actually puts your needs first.
The election has come and gone. Now, let's get to work.
Issa, R-Vista, represents California's 49th Congressional District.

Global Hollywood feeling sting of U.S. travel uncertainty

Los Angeles producer Rossi Cannon relies heavily on foreign directors and cinematographers to make commercials for brands such as Nike. Cannon, 48, had never entertained the possibility that her access to Hollywood's global talent pool might be limited, she said. 
Now she's not so sure. 
The election of President Donald Trump, she says, has increased anxiety in the entertainment industry about how the new administration's travel and immigration policies will affect visa applications and wait times for filmmakers and crew members who want to work on productions in the United States.
"It's scary," said Cannon, executive producer at Mod/Op Films. "I never thought I wouldn't be able to work with someone because they wouldn't be allowed into the country." 
Cannon's concerns reflect widely shared worries in Hollywood that the administration's stance could cause headaches for the entertainment industry, which overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton. The film and TV business has become increasingly global, with film companies pursuing non-U.S. stars and international co-productions that depend on people's ability to travel the world with relative ease. 
Hollywood's fears were exacerbated over the weekend after the new president signed an executive order which temporarily blocked travel from seven majority-Muslim countries and halted refugees from around the world on security grounds.
Asghar Farhadi, the Iranian director of Oscar-nominated "The Salesman," said he would not travel to Los Angeles to attend the Academy Awards ceremony in response to Trump's executive order.
21st Century Fox chiefs Lachlan and James Murdoch said the travel ban had caused "real uncertainty."
The Motion Picture Association of America, the lobbying arm for the major studios, went further. Chris Dodd, the former Democratic senator from Connecticut who heads the MPAA, joined the Hollywood chorus of disapproval against the order that temporarily suspends travel from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
"The MPAA is concerned about the impact of the executive order on individuals with legitimate personal and business relationships in the United States," Dodd said in a statement. "Among those potentially affected are members of the creative community who cannot freely express themselves in their home country and come to the United States seeking the opportunity to communicate and enlighten."
While few filmmakers are directly affected by Trump's travel ban, immigration experts who work with talent say the fear is that broader scrutiny and restrictions will come. 
Any overhaul in the visa application process could create delays that will have ripple effects in Hollywood, potentially throwing a wrench into productions that rely on foreign talent, immigration experts said. The Trump administration has indicated it will revise the application process for H-1B visas, one of the more popular visas used for highly skilled workers in fields like technology. Major tech companies have pushed to protect H-1B visas, and firms such as Google and Apple were among the first big companies to protest the executive order.
But changes to the visa program could also impact areas such as animation that rely heavily on non-citizens, said Chad Blocker, a partner at New York-based immigration law firm Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy.
"One challenge for the entertainment industry is you have tight production schedules, and it's necessary for talent to travel to the U.S. in a relatively short time frame," Blocker said. "If you see the government delaying processing, it's going to be even more of a challenge."
Some, however, are optimistic about visa reforms. Rosanna Berardi, an immigration attorney whose clients include TV and film studios, said she believes the proposed changes will, in fact, make the H-1B program more business-friendly.
"It's a very broken system now," Berardi said, who is based in Buffalo, N.Y.
But for now, uncertainty prevails. Several immigration attorneys said they've been bombarded with requests to file and expedite applications for work permits to let foreigners work on U.S. film and television productions. O-1 visas, which cover people with "extraordinary ability" in fields including arts, sciences and athletics, are in high demand. 
While there's been no explicit indication that the government will restrict O-1 visas, entertainment workers have been racing to make sure they're covered, said Los Angeles-based immigration lawyer Lorraine D'Alessio.
Since the election, she said, her law firm has tripled the number of cases it usually handles. One Swedish client, who was born in Iraq, passed on a film acting job out of fear he would run into trouble abroad, she said. 
Even prior to the executive order, U.S. consulates worldwide were taking more time to review and scrutinize applications, causing delays, D'Alessio said. "It's been a real nail-biter," she said. "People are wondering whether they should invest in certain productions."
Meanwhile, Hollywood business leaders have expressed misgivings about the temporary clampdown on travel. 21st Century Fox, an entertainment juggernaut with business interests around the world, issued a statement late Monday that stopped short of criticizing Trump's order, but nonetheless expressed concern about employees who might find it difficult to travel.
"We want to assure you that we're doing what we can to assist impacted colleagues and their families," read the memo signed by Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch and Fox CEO James Murdoch.

Past presidents wanted Mexico to be U.S. ally
Regarding "Trump rattles world leaders as Cabinet tries to soften tone" (Feb. 3): While it was undoubtedly in the U.S. national security interest for the first Bush administration to foster the trade agreement known as NAFTA to strengthen the Mexican economy, it would be folly for the Trump administration to think that Mexico has limited tools available if it wishes to end our long-positive relationship with our neighbor. 
Mexico could, if it wished, substantially strengthen its relationship with an expansionist China as a counter to a threatening U.S. president. 
It could stop selling oil to the U.S. and divert it to oil-hungry China and Japan, as well as facilitate the establishment of a Western Hemisphere Chinese naval base on Mexico's west coast. This would not benefit the U.S., but it might create a valuable stable strategic relationship for Mexico with China.

Mexico is taking us over little by little
Mexico has colonized California and the United States. It has done so in violation of U.S. law. And no one has raised a hand to stop it. 
On the contrary, everyone seems to be in accord with it. Now I know how the Palestinians feel.

Our nation must not let history repeat itself
Regarding Lori Shein's letter ("Trump's executive orders draw opposing views," Jan 31). I believe she's referring to the German liner MS St. Louis, which left Hamburg with more than 900 Jewish passengers seeking refuge from Nazi Germany in May 1939.
Their destination was Cuba, but due to political turmoil there, they were rejected. They next turned to the U.S. for asylum, but the Roosevelt administration also turned them away. It is believed that some of FDR's advisers were anti-Semitic. Passengers were forced to return to Germany, where most of them ended up in concentration camps or worse. 
I'm not saying Trump is another dictator, but if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, hmm.

Fear of refugees is nothing new to the U.S.
The 90-day ban against seven mostly Muslim nations preventing their citizens from entering the U.S. is bad enough, but it could be worse, and it has been.
In July 1950, during the Korean War, U.S. troops were ordered to fire on fleeing refugees, fearing they were infiltrated by North Koreans. It started with attacks from the air and ended after three days with U.S. soldiers machine-gunning refugees under the bridge at No Gun Ri. Few were left alive. Hundreds were killed, mostly women and children. 
It pains me to repeat this, but we must learn and guard against it. We must aid these poor people, certainly not harm them.

Hunter seems like a fit in Trump's Cabinet
After reading your front-page story about Rep. Duncan Hunter ("Rep. Hunter mixed his personal, campaign expenses," Jan. 30), and all his shady campaign finance shenanigans, I just have one question: Why hasn't Trump brought him into his administration?

San Diego must answer the homeless problem
I wonder how many times Mayor Faulconer will have to see and hear that his city, our city, is a national disgrace because of our homeless crisis before he starts paying attention.
Dan McSwain's excellent reporting on this crisis ("Homeless crisis is solvable, but won't yield to political inaction," Jan. 30) offers a plausible explanation for this disgrace: a glaring lack of leadership from Mayor Faulconer.
In spite of all our government agencies and nonprofits pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into solutions, the crisis grows worse by the day. Why?
Other American cities with strong political leadership are making major strides in solving their homeless problems by coordinating all their funding resources and concentrating on the housing first and permanent supportive housing programs.
Mayor Faulconer hired a political consultant, Stacie Spector, last October to be his senior adviser for homeless solutions. For what? When will Mayor Faulconer take responsibility?

Rep. Issa says he wants to listen but does not
Darrell Issa's recent piece, "Republicans' mission? Listen more, talk less" (Jan. 26) is nothing more than a public relations ploy. Issa has a track record of avoiding his constituents. He has ignored requests for meetings in face-to-face town-hall forums, and his local staff arbitrarily refuses to engage with citizens.
On Inauguration Day, 26 constituents visited his Vista office. Our goal was to deliver a signed letter stating our concerns on a variety of issues. Issa was in Washington, and his staff refused to open the door or acknowledge us even after 90 minutes. We left the letter outside the door only later to have staff deny they received it. This is bad faith.
These are public servants whose jobs are to serve local citizens. Local voters are trying to get their message to Issa, but he really doesn't want to listen.

H1B visa program does not help Americans
Regarding "Why is Rep. Issa now so willing to listen?" (Jan. 30): Couldn't agree more with Gregg Ferry about the need to improve our education system. Get rid of Common Core and the U.S. Department of Education. 
States and municipalities are better suited to educate our children. Encourage college students to get employable degrees, such as accounting, computer science or finance, etc., not in communications, psychology or arts, etc.
But he doesn't understand completely the H1B visa program. Immigrants often put Americans out of high-paying jobs and are paid less. The H1B immigrant replaces Americans in specialty occupations as occurred at Disney. It fired American employees who were required to train their less-qualified H1B replacements. Disney is not unique.
H1B immigrants can stay three to six years. The fired Americans often settle for lower-paying jobs, sometimes two jobs to replace their lost income.
Gary Ritzman

We should think about how to care for elderly
Regarding "Med students learn the pains of aging" (Jan. 30): Thank you for the article regarding UCSD med students learning the challenges for older patients. 
I believe all doctors should circulate this article to all employees in the office. My son installed a handrail on my steep stairs for Christmas. Grab rails in the bathrooms became a necessity. Think about this when pondering, "I just don't know what present to get for my parents."

Panelists at the San Diego County Economic Roundtable fielded a number of questions from the audience. Here is an edited transcript of part of that discussion. 
What do you make of the in-migration, out-migration patterns? Whether that poses some danger signals to the economy? In other words, people can't afford to live here so they come and then they leave.
Ray Major:  About 70 percent of the growth that we have in the region is from natural increase, so that's more births happening than deaths. The rest of it is due to in-migration for economic reasons.  I think that a lot of the reasons it slowed is because the economy has been slow for several years.  So fewer people are coming to the region for pure economic opportunities. I think the housing prices, too, cause people to have to go out further to find affordable housing. So areas like Temecula that are more affordable, become where people end up locating when they want to purchase a home.  I don't know that I see that as necessarily a problem to the labor force. I think that if job creations started to increase here in the region that we would see more people  wanting to come to San Diego for economic opportunities. 
Alan Gin: Let me just add one thing to that. There's also  a certain number of people who have taken their appreciated home in San Diego, sold it, pocketed the cash and have gone to a place where that money goes farther.
Are we in a housing bubble in San Diego?
Alan Gin: We say the situation is different than before the Great Recession. The rate of single-family housing construction is way down. We were again in the 10,000 range in terms of single-family units authorized before the Great Recession. Now not so much. So even though prices are high, even though they're approaching their historic high, I think we have less of a bubble situation than we did before the Great Recession.
Ray Major: Just to add to that, the last bubble in large part was caused by, in my opinion,  speculation and also in the ability to borrow money much more easily than you can borrow money now. I think if there is a downturn, it's not going to be like it was the last time. There was a lot that went on as we went into the Great Recession, where a lot of people lost their houses. I don't think  that would happen now. But I think the affordability of housing is what we really need to keep an eye on, and as you see interest rates start to creep up, San Diego is going to be a very expensive place to live in terms of affordability. 
Where geographically are the jobs? And how is that affecting the quality of life in San Diego? 
Tina Ngo Bartel: It depends on which jobs you're looking at.  If you're looking at life sciences and manufacturing, we have hubs in South County, East County and North County and in the metro region. If you're looking at research and development jobs for life sciences, they're catered around the research institutions - around the universities and such. We predict that most of the jobs will be going in health care because of the population aging. And also into most of the technology jobs, because our innovation economy is constantly growing. We have a number of co-working spaces with folks that have these startup companies. The San Diego downtown area is increasing in terms of technology jobs there as well.
We've averaged a 3 to
 4 percent net deficit in trade for 15 years. Wouldn't balancing trade as Trump proposes improve our own GDP growth?
Alan Gin: It would if it could be done. The worry is that if we tried to reduce imports through the imposition of tariffs or something like that, that could set off a trade war.  That could particularly hurt us here in San Diego. I'm not talking about Mexico, but I'm talking about China. There's a lot of talk about China and we run a huge deficit against China. Let me point out that one of our major local companies, Qualcomm, has a big interest in China.  If there's any sort of retaliatory efforts by China, that could hurt us here.
What is the percentage of people leaving the workforce because of the Affordable Care Act? 
Alan Gin: We don't have big numbers as far as that is concerned. It's what Congress, though, called job lock. There was this phenomenon where people were staying in positions when they'd rather go to some other company or start their own business or  even leave the labor force - become a homemaker to care for individuals or to retire, simply because they could not afford the health care. The ability  to purchase health care without a connection to employment then is significant. It will be interesting to see if any of the proposed replacements  will address that situation. 
High-skilled workers who come here on a visa - if that's going to change under the Trump administration what will that look like? And what about refugees who have minimal English skill levels? What can they do?
Tina Ngo Bartel: I can't really talk about the H-1B visas. I'm not quite sure what that's going to look like. There's a new project that we're working on with social enterprises, and IRC has always been one of our partners in the workforce development world where they work with refugees in the region, helping them get employment. A couple of others have popped up. There's a San Diego Coffee Institute that just opened up, and their goal is to actually hire refugees and folks with limited English and train them how to work in retail. So it helps improve their customer service skills and English skills while they're there at the coffee site. They develop the skills basic enough for a different job that they can move on and transition onto other employment. So we're seeing a lot more social enterprises pop up in San Diego County.
Trump's pick for education secretary talks a lot about alternate schools, not public schools. What  do you make of her thoughts and whether that applies to San Diego school districts? 
Matt Doyle: Everywhere I go, everyone asks me about (Betsy DeVos). In our district we have five charter schools, so we have five alternate schools. We're a supporter of the charter movement started in '92 because we believe it pushes us as a traditional organization to compete. This is an increasingly competitive environment, traditional public education. I'll give you one example. About six years ago in the state of California we had about 320,000 students in the entire state engaged in some form of a charter or a choice-related school. And now it's over 500,000. They project by 2021 it will be a million. So we live in a very competitive environment. Districts that will survive will be those districts that embrace that competition. With Betsy and her thinking on it, my simple answer to that would be it's only going to get more competitive.
How is that going to impact businesses in the economy? I think a note of caution about competitive school choice is that more than half of charters fail. And here's the backend impact, kind of unintended consequences on students. If a student goes to a charter that fails, typically they come back into a traditional environment two or three years behind. So the traditional environment has to make up for that failure, and then prepare them to move forward. So there is a danger with competition. 
Are we missing the bigger question, which is this income gap between high-income millennials and the minimum wage millennials? 
Gina Champion-Cain: I have a real estate development company with a lot of smart, savvy, techy people making good money. And then I have 10 restaurants - soon to be 15 - of the majority of the workforce being paid minimum wage. And I have retail stores, which don't make that much more. So it's a battle and I'll tell you it's tough, this gap of the have and the have nots and how are we going to address that?
And housing is an enormous issue, obviously. I had a question asked of me what can the public do or what can government do to help provide more housing so that these millennials that are not in the higher echelon in terms of wage earners, how they can stay and live here? And Deborah (Ruane) addressed it beautifully when she said there has got to be reduction, there's got to be more incentive by the government to allow us to build this housing. Everybody thinks that the developers are rich and flying around in their private jets and, no, the majority us of are not. So we have to really beg for money and beg government to allow us to build affordable housing.
Deborah Ruane: Another opportunity is at the government level to allow the right kind of housing to be built. ADUs or Accessory Dwelling Units are something that was just passed at the state level. This is something that San Diegans have been terrified of for a long time. We've got to get into the mindset that we've got to come up with more creative types of housing. Multi-family is popular with the millennials because it's more affordable. A lot of them just aspire to get into multi-family housing because the supply isn't there. But there's a lot of opportunity here to work on workforce housing, which would be at about 120 percent of area median income or lower. We're an expensive city to live in. And we've got to figure out what types of housing we can provide and think outside of the box, literally.
Tina Ngo Bartel: Let me address the elephant in the room, since we're talking about millennials.  I'm on the latter half of the millennial generation, and I do own a single-family home. However, I do work for a nonprofit, therefore I also do side work in addition to the nonprofit, and I lived with two roommates up until this last month. So even though the cost of living in San Diego is very difficult, as a millennial you're resourceful. My roommates have multiple jobs. One is working for a gig worker, and also a restaurant - she has two different restaurant jobs. She loves her life because whenever she is off she's able to go out and enjoy San Diego. The other one is a full-time student who is going through a master's degree program. But I'm sharing my single-family home with my husband and two roommates. So as a millennial you're resourceful despite the lack of housing that's available in the region.
Alan Gin: This situation of inequality is just getting worse. There's  now a greater and greater premium being attached  to higher education and higher skills. I think Ray (Major) also showed that the job growth for the upper 25 percent was a lot higher than for the people at the bottom. So I think that's why we need to do some stuff to help people at the bottom.
What about people who are older than 50 years old? What are we doing, or what can we do to keep them engaged, employed and growing? 
Alan Gin: I think that's a huge problem. And it was exacerbated during the Great Recession. When businesses streamlined, a lot of them targeted their older and higher-paid workers. And now they're at an age where it's just difficult for them to get back into the workforce at the level of income that they had previously made. It was a conscious business decision to cut cost. I will identify that as a problem, but I don't have a solution at this point to dealing with that. 
Tina Ngo Bartel: I talked about this last year at the Economic Round Table, where we had a program called Platform to Employment. And it addressed specifically long-term unemployed workers. In this program we put our mature workers into a boot camp where they learned about the new hiring practices and how employers look through LinkedIn or look you up in social media. And all sorts of the new tips of the trade of looking for a job. It helped them build their confidence into job searching in this kind of environment. Then they were able to apply for work and get employment there. But  similar to the youth, unless you know what  is the environment and how people are hiring, you don't know how to apply for those jobs. So there are programs out there and our job is to keep promoting this is what employers are looking for. 
What does the future of retail look like with the advent of e-commerce?
Gina Champion-Cain: I think that obviously e-commerce has changed the entire complexion of bricks and mortar retail. That's the understatement of the decade. But I think that there's always going to be bricks and mortar that are relevant to communities. There's that word "relevancy" again.  I think that's what we focus on as a company (that sells)  lifestyle things. Our retail is in predominantly tourist areas or in the heart of neighborhoods. Very densely populated neighborhoods (where) the local store is still very relevant to the community. I'm not going around looking at shopping malls and putting stores in. I hate shopping malls. But I'm all about community,  my bricks and mortar, my specialty surf shops and boutiques and other things, I have a specialty food store, a community food market, they're in very specific neighborhood community-oriented areas that have very dense populations. Lots of foot traffic, and that's how I keep my bricks and mortar relevant. And I'm continuing to open more bricks and mortar, but I'm very specific in terms of where I locate. 
Alan Gin: I'm sorry to say that I think the era of the shopping center is about over. There already have been a lot of shopping centers across the country that have closed down. And I think we're going to see that trend continue. It's one of the things I mentioned on terms of automation and the Internet. Amazon said they're going to create 100,000 jobs that are going to be good-paying and that have benefits. So that will help offset that somewhere. But there's another huge group, retail workers, that we're going to have find jobs for, at some point. 
Deborah Ruane: I was going to reference the UTC development that's going on. And maybe Gina (Champion-Cain), you would be in that shopping center eventually, because they're putting massive amounts of housing there. That is one way to get the people to have the lifestyle that Gina was talking about and reinvigorate the shopping mall, but also the stores that are in there are going to change. They're going to have different uses. And it is going to be more community. So I think that's going to be a great example of how to take a shopping mall and repurpose it.

U.S. is losing to China

In the waning days of Barack Obama's administration, one of the president's advisory councils issued a report warning of China's plans to snatch control of the critical semiconductor industry. Its recommendation: "Win the race by running faster."
It is sound advice, but the new administration isn't listening. Donald Trump's policies, in fact, offer a road map for how not to compete with China.
That's because team Trump doesn't fully grasp the threat China now poses to the U.S. economy. China is marshaling massive resources to march into high-tech industries, from robotics to medical devices. In the case of semiconductors alone, the nation has amassed $150 billion to build a homegrown industry. In a report in March, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China pressed the point that the Chinese government is employing a wide range of tools to pursue these ambitions, from lavishing subsidies on favored sectors to squeezing technology out of foreign firms.
The only way for the U.S. to compete with those efforts is to "run faster." Yet Trump's ideas to boost competitiveness mainly amount to cutting taxes and regulation. Although reduced taxes might leave companies with more money to spend on research and development, that's not enough. The U.S. needs to do much more to help businesses achieve bigger and better breakthroughs.
Trump is doing the opposite. One reason U.S. companies are so innovative is that they attract talented workers from everywhere else. But Trump's recent suspension of fast-track H-1B visas could curtail this infusion of scientists and researchers. If his intention is to ensure jobs go to Americans first, he need not bother. The unemployment rate for Americans with a bachelor's degree or higher - the skilled workers that H-1B holders would compete with - is a mere 2.5 percent.
This policy isn't just a threat to Silicon Valley, but across industries. Michael McGarry, the chief executive officer of PPG Industries, worries about the effect visa restrictions would have on his paint-making business. "We create a lot of innovation because of the diversity that we have," he recently told CNBC. "We think people with Ph.D.s that are educated here should stay here and work for us and not work for the competition."
China will likely try to capitalize on this mistake. Robin Li, CEO of the internet giant Baidu, recently advocated that China ease its visa requirements to attract talented workers to help develop new technologies for Chinese industry, just the opposite of Trump's approach.
Trump's budget proposals are similarly a setback. He wants to boost defense spending by slashing funding for just about everything else, notably education. By one estimate, some $20 billion would have to get cut from the departments of education, labor, and health and human services to accommodate his plan. If Trump wants to contend with Chinese power, he'd be better off reversing those priorities - to create more graduates and fewer guns. He could offer proposals to make higher education more affordable for the poor, for instance, or to bolster vocational training. So far, there's little evidence he's making such spending a priority.
China, by contrast, is expanding access to education on a huge scale. Premier Li Keqiang, in his annual report at this month's National People's Congress, boasted that the number of youngsters from poor rural areas enrolled in major universities rose by 21 percent in 2016, while almost 8 million students will graduate from college this year, an all-time high.
And while China is focused on building new industries, Trump and his advisers remain fixated on old ones.
In a recent essay, Peter Navarro, the director of the White House National Trade Council, lamented the decline of the American steel, aluminum and shipbuilding industries. Yet he had almost nothing to say about developing the industries of tomorrow - whether robotics, biotech or something we haven't even thought of yet. The protectionist measures he and his boss seem to favor would actually stifle innovation by curtailing competition. If leadership in cutting-edge industries is ceded to China, America stands to lose the foundation of its global power, too.
Of course, China's industrial policies may not succeed. History tells us that bureaucrats don't do a particularly good job of driving innovation, as Japan has demonstrated. And China's own record suggests that the state is often better at subsidizing wasteful projects than creating vibrant new industries.
Betting on China to fail, though, isn't a sound strategy. The U.S. would be better served if Trump focused more on sustaining what already makes America great - its uncanny ability to invent the Next Big Thing. If not, American CEOs will have to run a lot faster and harder to win this race.

International student applications dip
The San Diego Union Tribune
March 17, 2017 Friday
Final Edition

Nearly 40 percent of colleges are reporting overall declines in applications from international students, according to a survey of 250 colleges and universities, released this week by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. The biggest decline is in applications from the Middle East.
Many officials cited worries among prospective students about Trump administration immigration policies. "International student recruitment professionals report a great deal of concern from students all over the globe," the study said.
On Wednesday, the federal judge in Hawaii who blocked the latest version of the administration's travel ban cited the financial harm the executive order posed to the state's university system, which recruits students and hires faculty members from the six target countries. (Washington state officials raised similar concerns in successfully challenging the first travel ban.)
Graduate schools appear to be feeling the worst pinch, with nearly half reporting drops. "Our deans describe it as a chilling effect," said Suzanne Ortega, president of the Council of Graduate Schools.
The numbers - while not yet final - are provoking anxiety in some programs that rely on international students, who bring more than $32 billion a year into the U.S. economy. International enrollment at U.S. colleges has been on the rise during the past decade, and for the first time exceeded 1 million students last year.
Still, despite the steady increase, the movement of students from one country to another is sensitive to fluctuations tied to political and economic forces. So some officials cautioned that a "Trump effect" is just one possible explanation for this year's application figures. Beyond that, many schools, including New York University, the University of Southern California and Northeastern University, reported that their international numbers are up. Purdue University reported a 1.2 percent decline in graduate school applications.
Also at play: uncertainty about the future of a visa program called H-1B that international graduates frequently rely on to remain in the United States to work.
For several graduate schools, the Trump administration's travel ban, which initially affected seven predominantly Muslim countries, could not have been more poorly timed. It was announced in late January as deadlines loomed for applications to some graduate programs, and it came on the heels of Donald Trump's virulently anti-immigrant rhetoric during the campaign.
Slumping graduate school applications can be seen at universities ranging from giant Big Ten public universities such as Ohio State and Indiana University to regional programs such as Portland State.

Drawing a fine 'line' for immigrants

Those who support President Donald Trump's increased immigration enforcement frequently say that immigrants should "get in line" to come to America, rather than enter without authorization.
But, what line?
For most people who might want to come to America, there is no line. Potential immigrants generally need a family member or employer in the U.S. as a sponsor before they can seek entry. And those who have such a host face waits that many would consider unreasonably long. 
Mexican brothers and sisters of American citizens who applied to come to the United States legally almost 20 years ago are just now getting green cards. 
For siblings in the Philippines, the delay is even longer - 23 years. Siblings from India have waited 14 years. Both sides in the immigration debate have used the concept of an immigration "line" in their rhetoric over the years. Those who want stricter limits on immigration say that unauthorized immigrants should wait their turn in line to come to the United States.
But even advocates of immigration reforms designed to accommodate unauthorized immigrants have talked about such a line. President Barack Obama pushed for allowing unauthorized immigrants to get in line to obtain legal status when Congress last considered an overhaul of immigration laws.
Some immigration attorneys took issue with the phrase when it was used in that context as well. 
Immigration attorney Edward Orendain said that the "line" is a misconception. "I can understand that some people feel they're frustrated that people are 'cutting in line,' but there is no line for some people, and for those who can get in a line, the waits are ridiculously long in some cases," Orendain said by telephone. 
There are a few legal options for people from other countries who want to move permanently to the United States: Family members or employers can petition for their green cards.
If they are from a country that has historically low rates of immigration to the U.S., they can join a lottery for a "diversity visa."
If they've been persecuted or tortured, they can be sent by the United Nations as refugees, or they can come straight to the U.S. border and ask for asylum. Some people don't qualify for any of these options. For those who do qualify, the wait can take decades.
Karla Rivera, 34, was born in Mexico when her mother, who held a green card in the U.S., gave birth a month early while visiting family in Mexico. Rivera has been waiting most of her life for legal entry to the U.S.
Rivera's mother received her green card in the 1980s as part of Ronald Reagan's amnesty program. Rivera lived with her grandmother in Mexico until her mother was able to bring her to the U.S. at age 5 under a family unity program created for immediate relatives of amnesty green-card holders.
Rivera's mother began trying to file the paperwork for Rivera to get a green card in 1991 and successfully filed all of the forms in 1998. Rivera is still waiting for her green card.
"You want to get to the finish line, but it doesn't seem like you're ever going to get there," Rivera said.
Rivera's attorney, Ginger Jacobs, said Rivera has a "hybrid status" because of the family unity program. She is neither unauthorized nor a resident.
Rivera excelled in school, but she was not eligible for any federal funding to go to college. She works as a nanny.
Every two years, she has to renew her status with the family unity program, which costs more than $500 with each renewal.
When she finally gets her green card, Rivera said, she's going to apply to become a U.S. citizen as soon as she can.
"When people say, 'The system is broken,' and people say, 'Well, they need to obey the law' - Karla and her mom obeyed the law," Jacobs said, "and she still has no green card. Where's the justice in that?"
Family members fall into four categories, and most categories - all of those besides "immediate relatives," like spouses and unmarried children under age 21, of U.S. citizens - are capped annually. 
The cap for family-sponsored visas is 226,000 per year, and employer-sponsored is 140,000, according to the State Department. Those caps have created backlogs. By law, no country's citizens can have more than 7 percent, or 25,620, of the capped visas given out each year. That means the wait for citizens of certain countries is, in some cases, much longer than others.
"For a sibling, that's a ridiculously long amount of time to wait," Orendain said. "Life doesn't stop just because you're waiting for a visa to become available. People, their lives change. They get married and have children. Some of them die. 
"How do we know where we're going to be 20 or 23 years from now?" Orendain added. "It's impossible for people to really make plans and be able to prepare for anything." 
Waits for employer-sponsored visas are not as long as family-sponsored visas, but some are still more than a decade. Potential employee immigrants from India face the longest delay, at 12 years for a skilled and professional worker visa. Vaani Chawla, a local immigration attorney, said one of her clients who came to the U.S. on a temporary work visa has been waiting for his green card since 2005. 
Because of a change in law in the early 2000s, Chawla said, her client has been able to stay working in the U.S. while he waits his turn. Living in that limbo can limit a person's ability to advance his or her career through changing jobs during that time period, Chawla said.
"They've been waiting for a very long time," she said. "Children grow up in that much time."
Rohan Bavadekar's application for a green card has taken so long that his immigration attorney moved from Houston to San Diego during the process.
Bavadekar, 39, applied for an employer-sponsored green card in September 2010 and knows he likely still has years left to wait. The State Department is processing applications from 2008 for his visa category if the applicant was born in India.
"There is this whole debate going on about immigration reform and everything. The people who get talked about more often are those people who came here illegally," Bavadekar said via telephone. "I don't see a word being spoken about people like us who are already here, who have been paying taxes, who have been always in status, and nothing has been done for us or even spoken about our situation. That is the most disappointing thing."
Bavadekar, who lives in Houston, is originally from Mumbai, India, and has lived in the United States since 2001. He came first on a student visa to get his master's degree in engineering in Texas. When he graduated, he switched to an H-1B visa, a temporary work visa.
He said he would like to see more priority given to those like him who have advanced degrees.
There are longer delays for employment visas for those born in China, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and the Philippines as well because of the annual caps. Those who support Trump's immigration policies want more restrictions on who can stand in the lines to begin with. Many push for fewer visas for family members, a move away from the U.S.'s historical emphasis on policies that prioritize family reunification. Some have suggested adding restrictions based on a hopeful immigrant's economic situation or moving to a merit-based system.
Those who oppose Trump's immigration policies want the U.S. to offer more legal routes to residency to increase the options for lines to stand in and reduce wait times. 
No matter which direction policy ends up moving, there are likely to be people who do not qualify to come to the U.S. through any program. Those who have no line to stand in may try to come, anyway. Migrant advocates say that if people get desperate enough, they will come whether they're allowed to or not.
Even U.S. Border Patrol's union, which has vocally supported Trump, seems to agree with that sentiment. 
"When it comes to people, we've found that you build a 20-foot fence, they build a 21-foot ladder," said Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, shortly after the November election.

MEXICO CITY 
With Donald Trump's presidency creating a rift in U.S.-Mexico relations, dozens of San Diegans and bajacalifornianos are joining forces this week in Mexico's capital, aiming to showcase their strong bilateral relationship and win support for border projects. 
Close to 90 people are making the trek from the border to Mexico City for three days of meetings with high-level Mexican officials that begin Monday. They carry a common message: that neither Trump's plans for a fortified border wall nor his call to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement will change the fact that Tijuana and San Diego are intensely interdependent on many fronts.
The delegation led by the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce includes the mayors of San Diego and Tijuana. Also on the roster are business leaders, customs brokers, logistics experts, real estate developers and others seeking to maintain strong cross-border ties amid strains at the national level.
The issues they champion are at once local and international in nature: trade, tourism, tech jobs, plans for a cross-border railroad and a new border crossing, the need for resources to fortify sewage collection in Tijuana and prevent cross-border flows.
"We see the critical need for collaboration," said Paola Avila, the chamber's vice president of international business affairs, one of the trip's organizers. Members of the delegation "share that same vision, no matter what party they belong to, no matter the level of government they serve, or if they're in the private sector or the public sector."
Business and political leaders in the San Diego-Baja California region have for years touted their strong ties. Earlier this month, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastélum pledged to continue working together through a renewed memorandum of understanding.
But for all the collaboration, the two communities are divided by an international border, and solving local problems often means gaining resources and support from the U.S. and Mexican federal governments. Thus the twice-a-year chamber lobbying trips - in the spring to Mexico City and in the fall to Washington, D.C. - allowing Tijuana and San Diego to speak with a common voice as they present their demands.
This trip is the first since Trump has been in the White House, and participants say that has changed the flavor of the gathering.
The president's plans to build a wall along the entire border - and statements that he intends to charge Mexico for the cost - has caused anger in Mexico. The president's calls for a border tax and the renegotiation of the NAFTA have created uncertainty over the future - and generated a measure of anxiety among border leaders.
"Certainly there is a new level of urgency that they feel right now," said Chris Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. "There is no doubt that people feel there is a lot on the line right now in the U.S.-Mexico relationship."
Mayor Gastélum, interviewed Sunday morning on the flight down from Tijuana, said the aim of this week's Mexico City trip "is mainly to send a very clear message that the Tijuana-San Diego mega-region can work together well."
Showcasing the unity can demonstrate the importance of both economic and cultural ties, and "regardless of what's said outside our cities, we are building bridges to strengthen that relationship," he said.
Groups represented on the chamber trip include the San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce, Smart Border Coalition, Tijuana Innovadora, Tijuana Economic Development Council, San Diego Port Tenants Association, and the Sportfishing Association of Southern California. Also on the trip are representatives of state and local government agencies: the cities of Tijuana, San Diego, Ensenada, Imperial Beach, Coronado, the Port of San Diego and the California Department of Transportation.
The Union-Tribune asked four participants to share what's on their minds as they prepare for the meetings.
Frank Carrillo, president and CEO of SIMNSA Health Plan, a Mexican company licensed in the United States that sees 1,000 patients a day in Tijuana and Mexicali. Carrillo said he has been on every chamber trip to Mexico City.
"The first thing is to bring a message of unity," said Carrillo. "A message that we here in this region believe in bridges, not walls, that we do not agree with the policies of the White House."
SIMNSA patients are primarily U.S. residents who come to Tijuana and Mexicali for treatment, 70 percent of them insured. Carrillo worries that Trump's statements and policies could bring a backlash against those who visit Mexico.
"The message to the Mexican government is that they must not adopt the mentality of Mr. Trump that we're beginning to see in some. Rather than making it easier for Americans to visit us, they're beginning to make it more difficult," said Carrillo, who was born in Mexico but came to the United States as a child.
"Mexico needs to know that we are united, that we are with them, that we are not against them," said Carrillo. "It's a message that's badly needed, much more so in Mexico City, they're not as close as we are here. They need the reassurance they are not in this thing alone."
Eduardo Acosta, president of the Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce.
A major issue for the chamber is the planned Otay Mesa East crossing, a commercial and passenger port of entry that would be the first tolled crossing on the California-Mexico border. The project is precedent-setting on several levels and is being planned jointly by the U.S. and Mexican federal governments.
For Acosta, the trip to Mexico City is a chance to get up to date on what is happening in Mexico at the federal level. "I want to know if they are on the same page as the U.S. government," he said.
Acosta also wants to hear first-hand from Mexican officials about NAFTA. "Will it be updated, upgraded, will it be canceled overnight?" asked Acosta. "I would like to see where Mexico is with that."
Acosta, a customs broker, said he found reassurance from U.S. officials during a recent trip to Washington, D.C. "The political people, they're surprised we're so worried about NAFTA and the border," Acosta said. "They say, 'NAFTA's not going to change overnight, it's going to be a transition thing,' " Acosta said. "My take is, 'OK, Mexican government, that's what I saw in Washington two weeks ago. Are you guys on the same page?' "
Adriana Eguía, executive director of Tijuana Economic Development Corporation (DEITAC). 
Eguía's group focuses on attracting foreign direct investment to the city. "NAFTA needs to be refurbished," said Eguía, who currently is more concerned about the effects of Trump's plan to lower U.S. corporate taxes from 35 percent to as low as 15 percent. "What would be the strategy of the Mexican government if that goes through?" she wondered.
DEITAC is also seeking support in Mexico City for an initiative to draw high-skilled foreign workers to Tijuana - focusing on people that U.S. companies have been wanting to hire, but who have been unsuccessful in obtaining a limited number H1B visas for these workers.
DEITAC proposes allowing them to work for those same companies from Tijuana, bringing a new pool of talent to the city.
"This offers the possibility to bring in direct investment, but in another mode," Eguía said.
Kenia Zamarripa, director of marketing and international affairs at Sportfishing Association of California.
Maintaining strong lines of communication with federal officials in Mexico City is critical for the association, she said. Its members are commercial fishing tour operators in Southern California whose clients often want to cross into Mexican waters - and that requires compliance with Mexican regulations.
The group's previous efforts have led to a change in policy by Mexican immigration officials, allowing U.S. fishing groups to obtain tourist visas online rather than being forced to stop at a Mexican port before they head to the Coronado Islands or other popular Mexican fishing areas off the Baja California coast.
But the group has faced a new challenge since last December, when Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto established a new biosphere reserve off the coast of Baja California that includes the Coronado Islands and Todos Santos Island, a famed surfing spot off of Ensenada. Fishing in the protected areas requires a special license, and association members are concerned about the additional cost and paperwork.
Traveling with a large binational delegation has helped raise the association's profile and win the attention of high-level officials, Zamarripa said.
Without that, "they might see us as a little group that has this need, that it's not that important," she said. "By us going as a group, they can see how big this is."

A quiet revocation

Come Monday, the Trump administration may quietly revoke the ability of hundreds of thousands of immigrants - almost all women - to legally work in the United States, forcing them to choose between heading back to their kitchens or leaving the country altogether.
They are the spouses of workers here on high-skilled visas, and are typically high-skilled themselves. Many have launched businesses that created jobs for U.S. citizens, whose employment may in turn be at risk, too.
Take, for instance, 37-year-old entrepreneur Keerthi Ranjith, who lives in South Riding, Virginia.
Ranjith came to the United States in 2004 as the dependent spouse of her husband, a software engineer on an H-1B visa. Ranjith, a teacher, knew that one condition of leaving India was that she would, at least temporarily, have to give up her rewarding career; at the time, spouses of H-1B workers were prohibited from doing paid work.
Still, her husband's company promised to sponsor him for a green card, which meant that in a few years both of them would again be able to work. She could put her professional skills to use and bring in a second income for their growing family.
At least, that's what she thought. The couple hadn't counted on the interminable green-card backlog for Indian nationals.
Under current law, there's an annual per-country cap on green cards, and it's the same number for every country regardless of population. That means people from tiny nations such as Lichtenstein can get green cards almost immediately after clearing the sponsorship and screening process, while those from countries such as India and China may wait decades.
Ranjith waited and waited. Restless at home but barred from getting a job, she volunteered at her children's school and began dreaming about one day launching her own business: an after-school tutoring center. She had her Indian educational credentials transferred and obtained a Virginia teaching license. She researched books and curriculums and scoped out locations.
Years passed, and members of Congress several times tried and failed to fix the broken green-card system. (Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, played a pivotal role in scuttling one effort.)
Finally, the Obama administration offered a workaround: Starting in May 2015, the administration announced, spouses of skilled workers awaiting green card approval would be allowed to work.
And so, after 11 years more or less on the sidelines, Ranjith was granted authorization to get a job - or, in her case, to start a business.
She moved fast. Within a month, she opened the South Riding Learning Center. Today nearly 250 students are enrolled, and she employs more than 15 people.
"All my employees," Ranjith is quick to note, "are citizens, of course. They were all born here."
Now, under President Trump in the White House and Sessions at the Justice Department, Ranjith and her 15 American employees may all lose their jobs.
As a senator, in addition to opposing green-card reform, Sessions vehemently objected to the rule that allowed Ranjith to open her business. Now he has a quick and easy way to eliminate her work authorization: He could stop defending it in court.
A lawsuit challenging the rule was filed in 2015 and recently landed in federal appeals court. The Trump administration asked for a 60-day pause to "allow incoming leadership personnel adequate time to consider the issues."
On Monday, those 60 days will be up.
The Justice Department, representing the Department of Homeland Security, hasn't tipped its hand, but Sessions' past statements bode ill for people such as Ranjith. A settlement with the plaintiffs would effectively allow Sessions to kill the rule without going through the long regulatory process normally required for repeal. (The advocacy group Immigration Voice asked to join the case on grounds that the government may not be adequately representing the interests of its members; the judge, perhaps waiting to see what the government will do, has not yet ruled on its request.)
Ranjith is not sure what she'll do if her work authorization is revoked, which would mean she could no longer run the business she started - and sank her family's savings into. If she couldn't sell it, she might have to file for bankruptcy. The financial loss could be so crushing that her family - including her two U.S.-born children - could decide to leave.
"I have waited patiently, I paid taxes, I volunteered, I waited for the rules to change, and I did everything correctly," she said. "But maybe this means we need to start over."
So tell me: Just how would it make America great again to drive away hard-working job-creators like Keerthi Ranjith?

Feds promise added H-1B visa scrutiny

The Department of Justice and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services both warned companies on Monday to be careful about following the rules when seeking H-1B visas to bring in highly skilled foreign workers. 
The warnings came as applications opened for the federal fiscal year that will start in October.
The Department of Justice said it was ready to investigate and "vigorously prosecute" companies that abuse the program and discriminate against American workers. USCIS said it would use site visits to monitor companies that have a high ratio of H-1B workers to U.S. workers and those whose H-1B employees contract out to work off-site at other companies.
Demand for the program has exceeded the number of available visas in the past several years. In both 2016 and 2015, the congressionally mandated cap on the visas, 85,000, was reached less than a week after the program began accepting applications.
The H-1B visa program, which provides three-year worker visas that can be renewed once, has been a source of controversy with many on both sides of the political aisle. There's concern that companies exploit the program to bring in cheaper labor to replace American workers.
In one California example often cited by the program's critics, Southern California Edison laid off about 400 employees in early 2015 and brought in workers through consulting companies.
One of those companies, Tata Consultancy Services Limited - headquartered in India - has historically been near the top each year for the number of H-1B applications in the San Diego area, according to data from the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation.
Edison said at the time that it was not replacing American workers with H-1B workers, but local politicians have called for tightened regulations on the program since the incident.
Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, co-sponsored a bill last year with Rep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, that would have changed rules about exemptions from the requirement that employers prove they first tried to hire American workers. In a rare bipartisan effort, the entire San Diego delegation backed the bill, but it did not make it to a vote.
Benjamin Trounson, spokesman for Tata, said via email that Tata has "significantly reduced" use of H-1B visas in recent years. He said Tata used fewer than 1,500 in 2016 and "may use even fewer in the coming years."
He said the Department of Labor conducted an audit of Southern California Edison and found that Tata was compliant with U.S. regulations.
Tata had 72 certified H-1B applications for workers to come to San Diego in 2016, according to data from the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation, the fourth highest of any company in the region. That's down from 103 certified applications in 2015.
There were 3,863 certified applications for H-1B visas for San Diego jobs in 2016.
At 364, Qualcomm stayed at the top of the list with the highest number of certified applications in 2016. Including affiliated companies with slightly different names, Qualcomm had 480 applications. Qualcomm did not respond to requests for comment.
Qualcomm's average salary for H-1B applications in 2016 was more than $100,000 per year. Tata's was less than $70,000 per year.
April Hardin, a U.S. citizen who used to work for Tata, said she was laid off in December after she was replaced with workers from India on a contract with Microsoft.
Hardin, 61, of Pope Valley, said she knew Microsoft was working on replacing some parts of her job with automation before the H-1B workers arrived to take her place.
She said she would have considered taking a pay cut to keep her job, but that was never offered to her.
"I just would like to see the U.S. worker protected and given opportunity before they go and put a foreigner in our spot," Hardin said by telephone.

STOCKS AT A STANDSTILL: Stocks moved between gains and losses all morning after the Labor Department said employers didn't add as many jobs as analysts had forecast. They started to rise in afternoon trading, but those gains didn't last. Investors bought high-dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts and household goods makers, but banks and energy companies fell.

CONSUMER BORROWING UP $15.2B: Consumers stepped up their borrowing in February as a rebound in the use of credit cards offset a slowdown in auto and student loans. Total borrowing rose $15.2 billion in February, the biggest gain in three months and an acceleration from January's increase of $10.9 billion, the Federal Reserve reported Friday. The jump came in the category that covers credit cards, where borrowing rose $2.9 billion after falling in January. Borrowing from auto loans and student loans increased by a sizable $12.3 billion in February. 
HONDA RECALLING 37K ACCORDS: Japanese automaker Honda said Friday it was recalling 37,000 vehicles in the U.S. to check if replacement air bags contain the recalled Takata inflators that may have been installed prior to the massive Takata recalls last year. Honda Motor Co. said the recall of the front air bag inflator of the 2003 2-door Accord doesn't affect its vehicles in other regions. No ruptures have been reported. The inflators made by Japanese supplier Takata are blamed in at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries worldwide. The latest recall is unusual in that Honda is trying to find 2,500 inflators that were replaced during repairs, but it doesn't know where the 2,500 inflators went, so it's recalling all of the possibly affected vehicles so they can be checked. 
H-1B VISAS HIT CAP IN 5 DAYS: H-1B visa applications have reached the program's annual cap of 65,000 in just five days, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said Friday, as corporate America's demand for employing skilled foreign workers in the United States remains strong. Applications opened Monday for the 2018 federal fiscal year. U.S. businesses use the H-1B program to employ foreign workers in jobs requiring specialized knowledge, including science, engineering and computer programming. Critics say the use of foreign workers erases opportunities for U.S.-born workers to land well-paying jobs.

Trump order may curb foreign workers

KENOSHA, Wis.
President Donald Trump, hammering his "America First" campaign theme, signed an order Tuesday that he said would favor American companies for federal contracts and reform the visa program for foreign technical workers.
After recent policy reversals that have angered his populist base, Trump described the visa program as an initiative gone awry that has driven down wages for Americans. The order was a means to end the "theft of American prosperity," which he said had been brought on by low-wage immigrant labor.
Yet the order calls for a series of relatively modest steps, like a multiagency report on changes needed for the H-1B program, under which the government admits 85,000 foreign workers annually, many of them in the high-tech, industrial, medical and science fields. Collectively, the efforts outlined in the order could take years to carry out.
The H1-B program has become a focus in the debate over the impact of foreign workers. Trump has criticized employers for abusing the program and using it to avoid hiring higher-paid American counterparts. He vowed to revamp its lottery-based selection process.
The order, signed at the sprawling Snap-on tool factory here, represents a small win for bigger tech companies, which have been in pitched battles for those visas. Companies like Google and Microsoft, which rely heavily on high-skilled foreign workers, had worried that Trump would make drastic curbs to worker programs that could cripple them.
"I think people are cautiously optimistic that this will be OK, and maybe even better," said Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle firm that invests in high-tech startups.
But the order would likely hurt the biggest users of the visa program, technology outsourcing firms that bring foreign workers to the United States to perform technical jobs, typically from India.
On the campaign trail, Trump stoked outrage from his supporters with accounts of companies like Walt Disney forcing laid-off technical workers to train their overseas replacements.
On Tuesday, Trump spoke in terms of an apple-pie populism that helped him pull off upset victories in November in Midwestern states like Wisconsin.
H-1B visas "should include only the most skilled and highest-paid applicants and should never, ever be used to replace American workers," Trump told a gathering of about 500 workers and local luminaries, including the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who hails from Kenosha.
On this point, many executives at U.S. technology companies agree with Trump. They argue that they mostly apply for H-1Bs for workers when they can't find qualified American workers, usually those with advanced degrees like a master's or Ph.D.
In recent years, there has been so much demand for H-1B visas that the whole fiscal year's allocation has run out in a few days in April, when applications are accepted. The visas are then awarded by lottery to qualified applicants. Some 600,000 to 900,000 immigrants are in the United States on H-1B visas, researchers estimate.
Outsourcing firms - the top 13 of which accounted for a third of all granted visas in 2014, the last year for which information is publicly available - typically flood the system with visa applications. The top recipients were Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro, all from India.
India's leading tech trade group, the National Association of Software and Services Companies, said Indian companies were being treated unfairly. "We believe that the current campaign to discredit our sector is driven by persistent myths, such as the ideas that H-1B visa holders are 'cheap labor' and 'train their replacements,' neither of which is accurate," the group said in a statement.
Companies like Microsoft, Intel and Amazon are also big recipients. At least 15 percent of the American workforces of Facebook and the chipmaker Qualcomm hold H-1Bs, according to the most recent documents the companies have filed with the Labor Department.
The announcement came at a jittery time for the White House, as Trump faces the 100th day of his presidency without much to show for it in the way of legislative accomplishment, after the defeat of his health care overhaul. And his two high-profile executive orders cracking down on immigration from predominantly Muslim nations have been stymied by the courts.
"This does nothing," said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. "Like all the other executive orders, it's just words - he's calling for new studies. It's not going to fix the problem. It's not going to create a single job."
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, whose district includes Silicon Valley, said the issue of foreign workers was real, but dismissed the president's order as poorly targeted and unlikely to achieve its desired result.
"Half of the startups in Silicon Valley were created by highly skilled people from other countries," she said. "I don't think the president and his staff fully appreciates that fact."
In a briefing with reporters Monday, White House officials said the "Buy American and Hire American" order would also overhaul federal procurement practices to increase the selection of products from U.S. companies, especially in the domestic steel industry, which has faced stiff competition from China.
One reform advocated by the Trump administration, which has drawn bipartisan support from Congress, would change the lottery system for awarding H-1B visas, giving extra preference to the highest-paying jobs - a proposal favored by many in the U.S. technology industry.
Blake Irving, the chief executive of domain name and web hosting firm GoDaddy, said he supported the idea of changing the system for issuing H-1Bs to give priority to higher-skilled workers. He said GoDaddy typically receives only about 20 percent of the H-1B visas it applies for.
"If anything, it moves the policy toward something that's preferential to the expert workforce," Irving said.
But some smaller technology companies said they were concerned about the changes proposed by the Trump administration.
Punit Soni, the chief executive of Learning Motors, a six-person company in Silicon Valley that is trying to apply artificial intelligence to health care, said the visa changes proposed by the Trump administration would hurt startups.
Small companies cannot afford to pay high salaries and are already struggling to attract talent in a tight market, he said. A visa system that favors the highest-paid workers will steer immigrants only to already successful big companies like Google, his former employer.

Startups offering paid time off to protest

Silicon Valley firms have long been known for offering a litany of employee perks: Home-cooked lunches, free massages, climbing walls and dog-friendly offices. 
Now some are adding yet another incentive to attract - and retain - workers: Paid time off to protest.
Fauna, a San Francisco-based database startup, recently began allowing its 13 employees to take unlimited paid leave to participate in rallies, vote, write letters to elected officials and take part in other civic activities. Before February, employees could take time off on an as-needed basis. But the political climate - and polarization - following President Donald Trump's inauguration called for more defined measures, said Amna Pervez, director of recruiting and retention.
"Since there's been such a divide in our country, we felt we should be very explicit about our policy," Pervez said, adding that the company also provides unlimited vacation time. "We want our employees to know that we absolutely support the betterment of our country. People can take whatever they feel like they need to make a meaningful difference."
A number of other startups, including Turbine Labs, Buoyant and Jelly Industries, have signed on to do the same. The new policies come as technology firms and other companies take a stand against the Trump administration's plan to tighten restrictions for foreign workers. On Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order that could lead to new restrictions on H1-B visas, a type of temporary work visa often used by firms to recruit and employ highly-skilled workers.
"If you're a tech company, taking a pro-immigration stand is not exactly a bold move," said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School. "When there's a tight labor market and companies are fighting for programmers, this is a way to say, 'See? We're here to support you.'"
Facebook, for example, is allowing its employees to take time off to participate in pro-immigration rallies on May 1. The company, which relies heavily on foreign workers, informed employees and contractors last week that they would not be penalized for missing work to protest, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.
"At Facebook, we're committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where employees feel comfortable expressing their opinions and speaking up about issues that are important to them," a company spokesman said in an email. "We support our people in recognizing International Workers' Day and other efforts to raise awareness for safe and equitable employment conditions."
Facebook could be particularly hard-hit by any changes the Trump administration makes to H-1B visa policies. More than 15 percent of its employees used temporary work visas last year - a higher percentage than at Google, Apple, Amazon or Microsoft, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Labor Department filings.
At Atipica, a software startup in San Francisco, four of the company's five U.S.-based workers are immigrants. Founder Laura Gómez, who is from Mexico, said it was a "no-brainer" to give workers paid leave to make their voices heard.
"At this point in our political reality, it's really, really important to allow my employees to do something that not only affects them, but also the direction of our country," she said. "This is what democracy looks like: People having the freedom to stand up for what they believe in."
There are some ground rules, though: No violence, or activities that make others feel threatened.

U.S. needs to lead in computer science
Regarding "Why computer science should be a high school graduation requirement" (April 17): Your spot-on editorial deserves a one-word response. Duh! 
Does anyone really think we would need to import 85,000 foreign engineers via H-1B visas each year if every high school graduate had a grounding in computer science? 
If we accept the corporate importers' claim that there is a shortage of qualified U.S. engineers, isn't this the place to start?

Duncan Hunter needs to do the right thing
As a longtime supporter of Rep. Duncan Hunter, this is a difficult letter for me to write. His use of campaign money to fund personal expenses cannot be justified. His explanations don't make sense and defy logic. He says it was a mistake and that he paid back campaign money used for personal expenses.
That's like the bank robber giving back the stolen money and then thinking all is fine. He also states he personally did not make any of the charges, attributing them to his staff, of which his wife was a member, thereby throwing them all under the bus.
He is responsible for what happened and needs to be held accountable. It is time for him to do the right thing and resign from Congress.

Safer roadways will increase bike use
Regarding "San Diego is losing ground to the bicycle lobby" (April 21): Letter writers Eric Witt and Ken Johnson are looking at bike lanes from the wrong direction. Nobody is forcing anyone to bike instead of drive.
The various cities are only making roads safer for those who choose to bike. It's just a bonus if safer roads encourage more cyclists.
In 2011, the most recent year that figures are available, there were 2,515 bicycle traffic injuries in the city of San Diego alone. Yes, the cyclist was usually considered to be at fault, but if car drivers hadn't turned in front of them, the number would undoubtedly be much lower.

DMV should offer discounts to donors
Regarding the article on the cardiologist and need for donors for heart transplants: Since people are reluctant to donate (due to any number of reasons) and those who do sign up have it noted on their driver's license, perhaps a Department of Motor Vehicles discount on charges such as registration, etc., for those who sign on as a donor would be an incentive for more people to consider it. 
And since DMV services' costs are about to go up, it might make enough difference in the number of people willing to sign up, thus making donor hearts (and other organs) available, to save additional lives.

Trump only cares about certain kinds of jobs
Regarding "Why all jobs matter" (April 18): Columnist Paul Krugman wonders why Donald Trump seems obsessed with reviving a handful of coal-mining jobs while, among other employment crises, 270,000 jobs have disappeared from America's newspaper industry.
Can't you just see our prevaricator-in-chief reaching out to save jobs in this truth-obsessed profession where he himself, and his endless misstatements and falsehoods, have become Job One?

This is not the America most would call 'great'
The U.S. already has a "deportation force" - the Border Patrol - the largest federal law enforcement organization in America, which presides over 6,000 miles of our borders. Officers are armed and, near the border, can enter your property (but not your home) without a warrant. 
The Border Patrol is supposed to protect us from terrorists and criminals. Instead, it recently deported vulnerable teenagers from a trolley station and a Dreamer who was denied access to a lawyer or immigration judge.
Without doubt, immigrants invigorate San Diego culture and economy. The Mexican culture, in particular, is an integral element to our city's history, art, food and language. Homeland Security chief John Kelly and Trump display a disheartening animus toward our immigrant neighbors, instead of celebrating our inclusive neighborhoods.
Now the Border Patrol will grow and the bar regarding new hires will be lowered, risking further abuses of immigrants. Daily I ask, where is my beautiful America?

Enlightened GOP types now should apologize
Republicans have always fought tooth and nail to have a health care system that leaves people uncovered. Now some Republicans see the light and refuse to support a GOP bill that would take away people's health care again. 
Will there now be an apology from these Republicans for the decades of death and sickness they forced upon U.S. citizens? Having a policy position is fine, but you should apologize once you realize how terrible and awful your thinking was.

There are easier way to impose death sentence
The recent inhumane turmoil created by the state of Arkansas, and the 31 other states allowing the death penalty, could easily be avoided by replacing the current lethal injection method with the painless, quick and effective use of nitrogen gas. 
Within just a few minutes, one simply goes to sleep without pain or any feeling of suffocating. California and Arizona offer that option upon the prisoner's request.

Scott Pruitt's track record speaks for itself
During his watch as Oklahoma attorney general, along with other anti-science legislators, EPA chief Scott Pruitt allowed the creation of the worst human-made-earthquake problem in the country.
Thank God someone from his own party called him out on his ignorance related to climate change. Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a co-founder of the fast growing bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, reprimanded Pruitt on the situation.
Even the fossil fuel addiction enabling company, Exxon Mobil, urged the Trump administration not to pull out of the Paris Agreement, describing it as an "effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change" and the "first major international accord" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Fortunately, we have some wise elder Republican statesmen from the Climate Leadership Council proposing "The Conservative Case for Carbon Dividends." Hopefully, young foolish whippersnappers such as Pruitt will follow their lead.

Glad to see some people show initiative
Kudos to the individual who followed the hit-and-run driver that killed the woman in Oceanside last Sunday.
That person's willingness to get involved and obtain the license number of the suspect vehicle means that the culprit will most likely be apprehended and face punishment for his or her cowardly act. 
With the number of hit-and-run incidents in our county lately, it is good to know that some are willing to step up to the plate and help bring justice for the families of the victims. Whoever you are, thank you.

Poll: Border wall seen as harmful to economy

Many Americans think that building a border wall with Mexico would hurt the U.S. economy, according to a poll by public radio's Marketplace in partnership with Edison Research. 
The Marketplace-Edison Research poll, which has been measuring Americans' perception of the economy since 2015, found that Americans overall are less anxious about the economy than they were when the poll was conducted last year - with the exception of millennials. When asked about several of President Donald Trump's immigration policies, Americans generally said they thought those policies would hurt the economy.
About 57 percent of those polled said that a border wall would hurt the economy, while 37.7 percent said the wall would help the economy.
About 60 percent of those polled by Marketplace said they believe immigrants do the jobs that Americans don't want to do, while about 35 percent said they think immigrants take jobs away from American workers.
During his campaign, Trump indicated interest in restricting the number of short-term work visas given out. In a recent executive order, he called on members of his Cabinet to change the H-1B visa program, which grants a limited number of three-year work visas each year.
Almost 60 percent of those polled by Marketplace said they thought expanding the number of visas for short-term skilled workers would help the economy, compared to about 35 percent who said such a policy would hurt the economy.
There was one exception in the poll where responses aligned with Trump's policies.
About 54 percent of those polled said that allowing fewer refugees into the U.S. would help the economy, and about 38 percent said that policy would hurt the economy. Trump has tried twice to use executive orders to reduce the number of refugees coming to the U.S.
Those executive orders also restricted travel from several majority-Muslim countries. Both orders were blocked by courts, and arguments are set to be heard by a three-member judge panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in May.

Infosys to create 10K jobs in U.S.

Body


Infosys, a global tech outsourcing giant under fire from President Donald Trump for stealing American jobs, announced Tuesday it plans to hire 10,000 new U.S. workers over the next two years. 
The firm, based in India, plans to open four U.S.-based "hubs," starting in Indianapolis in August. The company expects that the Indiana site will create 2,000 jobs by 2021, said Vishal Sikka, chief executive of Infosys. 
"We want to create a culture of close proximity," said Sikka, touting the company's desire to train and hire graduates from local universities and community colleges during a news conference hosted at the state Capitol in Indianapolis. 
Critics have recently ramped up their attacks on outsourcing firms, including Infosys, in light of Trump's forceful "America First" rhetoric and the companies' rampant use of H-1B visas to bring tech workers to the U.S.
The visas are supposed to be used to import high-skilled foreign workers in the tech and science fields, but critics say firms like Infosys often use them to displace American workers and depress overall wages.
Trump last month reiterated his campaign promise to protect American workers and their wages as he signed an executive order at a Wisconsin tools manufacturer to overhaul the decades-old H-1B visa program. 
The U.S. outposts will focus on technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, digital technologies and big data, serving companies spanning a variety of industries from financial services to manufacturing and pharma. 
Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb praised the announcement Tuesday morning as historic and "game changing." 
"We're celebrating our futures together in Indiana's tech eco-system," Holcomb said. "You can't even spell Indiana without starting with India." 
Infosys, founded in 1981 and headquartered in Bangalore, was the first Indian IT company to be listed on NASDAQ. It has more than 200,000 employees worldwide in consulting and IT services.
Multinational outsourcing firms, many of which are based in India, are exempt from the federal requirement that they not displace American workers provided they pay H-1B visa holders at least $60,000 a year. That threshold still falls below the market rate for American tech workers. 
The Labor Department in 2015 cleared Infosys of any wrongdoing after American technology workers at Southern California Edison complained they were wrongly displaced by foreign workers on H-1B visas. The company maintained it had complied by U.S. immigration laws.

Attorney honored for work with abuse victims

The deck can be stacked against victims of domestic violence, who often face fear, injury, financial ruin and emotional turmoil over leaving their abuser. For those who are unauthorized immigrants, the hurdles can be magnified by worries that reporting the crime could separate them from their children and their adopted country.
Many in that situation have found an advocate in Christina Helwig of Escondido. The 38-year-old immigration law attorney has spent the last five years doing pro bono work for clients in shelters in Orange County, as well as many others who are dealing with difficult immigration issues. Helwig's efforts were honored last month in Anaheim, when she received a Spirit of Volunteerism Award from OneOC, an Orange County nonprofit resource center.
The award recognized Helwig's volunteer efforts with Human Options, an Irvine nonprofit that has counseled and sheltered more than 32,000 victims of domestic violence. Helwig shares her expertise in monthly immigration law forums and in one-on-one legal consultations at regional law clinics, and has handled cases for nearly 200 clients.
Helwig said seeing how her work can positively affect the lives of others has been gratifying.
"There's nothing that can describe the feeling when you first meet someone in a shelter and they have this cloud of gray around them," she said. "A few months later, especially when you're starting to help them fix their status, they become shiny and vibrant. Their whole demeanor changes. It takes me back to why I wanted to go to law school in the first place."
Helwig grew up in the Bay Area city of Alameda, where her parents divorced when she was young. Family finances were tight and she describes her childhood as very difficult. Her father and grandfather, who ran a dive shop, often volunteered their services to law enforcement in search-and-rescue operations, which she admired. By the time she was in high school, Helwig said she felt drawn to the law herself.
"I didn't really know what I was getting myself into but law was something that made order out of chaos, and that appealed to me," she said.
After studying pre-law at Cal State University Hayward (now named CSU East Bay), she attended UC Hastings law school in San Francisco. During school, she spent a semester as a law clerk for San Mateo County's District Attorney's Office. When she earned her law degree in 2005, she spent six years with a firm that specializes in insurance defense cases. It was lucrative work, but Helwig said she wasn't completely fulfilled with what she was doing or the place she was doing it.
In 2000, she met her future husband, Ray Stendall, who was at the time a Bay Area tech worker. He grew up in Canada, the child of Romanian immigrants who'd fled the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu. When the recession hit, Stendall lost his work visa due to corporate downsizing and she saw the difficulties he faced trying to clear up his H-1B visa status.
Around 2009, they moved to Orange County to escape the traffic and congestion of the Bay Area. For three years, she continued working long distance for the insurance defense firm. Then in 2012, she started her own law practice in San Juan Capistrano. At the same time, she began working as an apprentice in a friend's firm that specializes in immigration law. That work took her into battered women's shelters and right away, Helwig said, she knew she'd found her calling.
"I just felt like this is where I belonged," she said. "It's hard to put into words but I believe that lack of access should not limit your ability to get help when it's needed most."
Helwig's clients include unauthorized abuse victims who are married to abusers with permanent legal status, unauthorized victims of crime who are cooperating with law enforcement, DACA cases (unauthorized young adults brought to the U.S. as young children) and families trying to fix their immigration paperwork. Helwig meets many of her pro bono clients at shelters, where she said her biggest challenge is earning the trust of clients who've often been beaten and lied to for years by their abuser.
Helwig - who speaks Spanish at 70 percent proficiency - said she comes into the shelters in street clothes to avoid intimidating these clients and works quickly to educate them on the law.
"The biggest challenge I'm trying to break through is establishing trust and undoing all the information their abuser programmed into them," she said. "They would be told 'the police won't help you' or 'I'll have the police take you.' Or if the abuser had papers or is documented, they'd say 'they'll give me the kids because you don't have papers.' "
Many times, the cycle of dependence in these relationships is hard to break and the victims return to their abusers. But Helwig said she doesn't get discouraged. Those clients almost always come back.
"Nobody wants to go into a shelter," she said. "By the time you get to that last resort, most of the things a client has been through can get very severe before they finally pull the trigger and say 'I'll drop everything and go into the shelter.' "
Helwig has worked with clients at shelters including Laura's House, the Women's Transitional Living Center (WTLC), Thomas House Family Shelter and Human Options.
Sara Behmerwohld, an attorney and legal advocacy program supervisor for Human Options, said Helwig has gone "above and beyond" for the nonprofit organization's domestic violence clients.
"Christina gets it," Behmerwohld said. "It's not something that can be taught in terms of how to appropriately and professionally work with a survivor of domestic violence while still providing competent legal advice. She has this outstanding ability to empathize and demonstrate care for the clients while still moving them forward on that (legal) path they're on."
Four years ago, Helwig and her husband moved to Escondido's Hidden Meadows neighborhood, where they now live on a small blackberry farm with their dachshund-Pekingnese mix, DaVinci. She doesn't mind the one-hour commute to work in Orange County each day because she's never found a more idyllic place on Earth than "DaVinci Farm."
Recently, she began volunteering her services to Interfaith Community Services in Escondido and she's hoping to open a new law office somewhere in North County, where she plans to continue doing the same kind of work with local residents.
"Being able to hand documents over the desk to someone and watch them light up ... I want to keep experiencing that," she said.

Body


In February, Sunayana Dumala lost her husband to a man who shouted "Get out of my country!" and unloaded a semi-automatic pistol in a Kansas bar. 
Dumala's immigration status was tied to that of her husband, Srinivas Kuchibhotla, one of two Indian-born engineers shot that day. So along with dealing with the horror of his sudden death, she also had to face the fact that the man who shot him may have managed to put her at risk of deportation.
Kuchibhotla was in the United States on an H-1B visa. Upon his death, Dumala's residency status was terminated. And when she went to India to attend his funeral, she feared that she might not be able to re-enter the United States.
It was also unclear whether she would want to. In an emotional Facebook post shortly after the shooting, she posed a question that she said "is in every immigrant's mind: Do we belong here?"
Her congressman, Kevin Yoder, a Republican from Kansas' third district, was "horrified" by the shooting, and pushed President Donald Trump to condemn it in a joint address to Congress. Upon learning of Dumala's immigration issues, he and his staff began looking at ways to assist her.
"It would have been a real tragedy, on top of the initial tragedy she suffered, to attend her husband's funeral in India and then be locked out of the U.S. because of it," Yoder said in an interview Wednesday. "This woman suffered enough. We need to fix this."
Kuchibhotla was sharing drinks with a colleague and friend, Alok Madasani, at a favorite bar in Olathe when a man sitting nearby began to question their visa status and whether they were in the country illegally.
The man, Adam Purinton, was thrown out of the bar. But he returned with a firearm and began shooting, killing Kuchibhotla and wounding Madasani, along with another customer who attempted to intervene. In June, Purinton was indicted by a federal grand jury on hate crime charges.
Yoder's office, working on Dumala's behalf, helped her obtain a 12-month employment authorization document that will grant her the time she needs to apply for her own H-1B visa.

Will the economy suffer if the DACA program is not renewed?

Body


Economists
YES An estimated 92 percent of 800,000 foreign-born residents covered by DACA are currently working and more likely to have white-collar jobs than unauthorized immigrants in general. Potential turnover costs to replace the workers could reach $3.4 billion according to some projections. The U.S. economy clearly benefits from (and needs) legal immigration. However, DACA was unconstitutionally implemented. Congress should pass a permanent legislative version of it and hasten the processing of properly applied for legal immigrants.
YES Many DACA recipients have been able to move into higher skilled jobs and participate in the formal economy. With greater earnings, recipients pay more in taxes and provide a boost to the economy through greater spending. If deported, these benefits would be lost, along with the labor recipients are supplying to organizations. The Cato Institute and the Center for American Progress both estimate the negative economic impact of eliminating DACA to be significant. 
YES There are 800,000 people covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Of those, 91 percent are employed. So not renewing DACA would lead to over 700,000 workers being taken out of the economy. That would be disruptive for the companies who employ them, particularly since the unemployment rate is low and the labor market is tight. That is why most companies, including tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and Google, are calling for the preservation of the program. 
YES Most of those affected by DACA hold jobs, pay taxes and contribute to society. Many are also employers with their own businesses. Purging these residents from our ranks would not result in an equal number of new jobs for our legal citizens. Many legal citizens, working for DACA dreamers, would lose jobs. The U.S. will need immigrants to fuel our economy, just as we need temporary workers to do the jobs Americans do not want to do.

NO Rescinding the DACA program will cause devastating harm to all currently protected by the program, but will not have a significant economic impact. Our economy is fiercely resilient as well as broad enough to weather the gradual loss of a combination of 800,000 students and early stage employees. Shrouding the discussion of DACA reversal as an economic rather than a human issue does great disservice to those affected. 
YES The average DACA recipient is 22 years old, employed, and earns about $17 an hour. The majority are students and 17 percent are pursuing an advanced degree. By contrast, most recipients of H-1B visas are between 25 and 34 and hold either a bachelor's degree or a master's degree. DACA recipients are more closely linked economically to H-1B visa recipients than other illegal immigrants. President Trump will not deport them. This is just politics. 
NO Before DACA expires the U.S. government will pass legislation to allow legal immigration status for those who have relied on DACA to remain in the U.S. This is a good reason why executive orders should not be used for these situations. It would simply not be right to deport those immigrants who are contributing to our economy. 
YES A 2014 study conducted at UCLA found that 84 percent of immigrants with DACA were employed. With an estimated 800,000 immigrants participating in DACA, terminating the program could reduce the workforce by as many as 672,000 persons, although this would depend on whether these individuals were actually deported. If they were, in areas with a high immigrant population and low unemployment, such as Southern California, there would likely be greater wage inflation.

Save our environment from Trump and Pruitt
Re "Trump administration to terminate Obama's climate plan: 'The war on coal is over'" (Oct. 9): The Trump administration is not doing you, your children or your grandchildren any favors by repealing the Clean Power Act. In the chaotic atmosphere of IQ challenges and Twitter wars, this administration is attempting to do real and lasting damage to our environment. 
Our secretary of pollution, Scott Pruitt, a shill for big oil and coal, is gutting the EPA and serving the interests of the fossil fuel industry. In a zeal to deregulate, good laws and regulations - those that protect our environment - are tossed aside. 
It's time to fight Pruitt and the greed of the Trump administration and to seek out real solutions like a carbon fee and dividend proposed by Citizens' Climate Lobby. The American Lung Association estimates that half of Americans live in counties with unhealthy air. Why are we supporting politicians and policies that make it worse?

Don't trick audiences into seeing a protest
Re "Trump gains upper hand in NFL battle over anthem" (Oct. 11): Tom Krasovic misses the point entirely in his article, which purports to support freedom of speech for some NFL players. 
Freedom of speech is not without bounds. One does not have the right to cry "fire" in a crowded theater. Nor does one have the "right" to lure paying customers into an event publicized as a sporting event or as musical theater and then subject them to a political or social diatribe or objectionable gestures.
It they are so outraged, these millionaire athletes and actors can rent a stadium or some other venue and "say their say" on their own dime. 
The apparent turnaround by NFL owners and the commissioner is most certainly not based on ethical issues, but rather on financial concerns as fans and sponsors turn their backs on players and teams that disrespect our flag and national anthem in public.

We should not be quick to forget shootings
Well, it's been less than two weeks since the horrific Las Vegas massacre and we, as a nation, have apparently already moved on. On to the latest episode of kneeling in the NFL or the absurd Trump tweet of the day. 
Have you noticed the recovery time for these mass shootings is getting shorter and shorter? Is it OK now to take steps (not just talk) about sensible gun legislation? Or still too soon?
Better yet, let's just wait for the next massacre. That seems to work well. With any luck, your loved one won't be a casualty. Then onto the next one.

Too many assumptions about TSA screening 
Re "Flying while Muslim: My name made me a suspect" (Oct. 5): Like Sarah Hassaine, I, too, have a U.S. passport. Mine does not list my religion.
Yet she writes with certainty that during secondary screening, her body was violated for no reason other than her name and religion.
Did she volunteer her religion to the TSA?
Mike Krawczak

Airport screenings don't serve a purpose
My heart broke reading Sarah Hassaine's piece about her humiliating treatment at the San Diego airport. The screening she was subjected to sounds like a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Do we honestly think these types of screenings keep us safe? 
The Las Vegas shooter purchased dozens of guns without batting an eyelash and our government allows that. 
I would feel safe in the company of someone like Hassaine - not in the company of many of the "law-abiding" gun owners in this country.

Don't impose religious beliefs on other people
Regarding blocking Mississippi's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender law, taking away birth control, etc., I do not understand how people can cite their own religious beliefs as the justification for not allowing another person to do something. 
If one doesn't want to practice birth control, then don't do it, but don't stop others from doing it by deleting it from health coverage. People who try to control the behavior of others based on their own religious beliefs are the same the world over. 
They will stone a woman for not covering her hair or subject an unwanted child to a disadvantaged life.

Limit H1B visas to help U.S. college graduates
If we want to give U.S. college graduates a chance at a job, it would help to stop issuing so many H1B visas: up to 85,000 annually, plus 6,800 for Chilean and Singapore nationals under free trade agreements and more under other exemptions and renewals. 
Make no mistake, corporations claim that the U.S. does not have the highly skilled workers needed. Balderdash! We are flush with college grads who leveraged their educations to the hilt and are living at home. 
Time to stop glad-handing the corporations (and politicians) and vastly reduce the H1B visa limits.

Feinstein re-election run sets off a debate
Re "The Dianne Feinstein debate is dangerous" (Oct. 11): Unbelievable that your excellent editorial states that Feinstein - given her ample evident competence - is under attack and you find it is progressive liberals "who otherwise vigilantly oppose such categorical bias" who are trying to unseat her? 
Progressive liberalism today has nothing to do with the "regressive illiberalism" and extreme political correctness of today. It is an ideological form of Marxism bordering on Bolshevism and the very worst of intolerance and identity politics.
David Porreca
Scripps Ranch
Sen. Feinstein is running for re-election. She, former Sen. Barbara Boxer, House leader Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Jerry Brown - all in their 70s and 80s - and their Democrat pals have run California for more than 30 years.
Looking around, I can't see how their progressive policies have made California better. Education, immigration, traffic, taxes, public safety, health care, housing, homeless, race relations all seem much worse.
Bernie Sanders, (the socialist) progressive, touts his health care road to bankruptcy. These "progressives" are really regressives showing a basic lack of common sense and lack of basic math skills. 
They are poster kids for term limit policies. Keep electing the same, you'll get the same. 
We need real solutions, not constant drum-beating on Trump. That's only to distract the gullible public.

Trump pressing the brakes on legal immigration

The Trump administration has pursued its immigration agenda loudly and noticeably, ramping up arrests of unauthorized immigrants, barring most travel from several majority-Muslim countries and pressing the case for a border wall. But it has also quietly, and with much less resistance, slowed many forms of legal immigration without the need for Congress to rescind a single visa program enshrined in the law. 
Immigration and State Department officials are more closely scrutinizing, and have started more frequently denying, visas for people seeking to visit the United States on business, as well as for those recruited by U.S. companies, according to lawyers representing visa seekers. Foreigners already in the United States whose employers wish to extend their stay also are facing new hurdles.
"I call this the real wall," said Anastasia Tonello, the president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. "The wall is being built."
The changes show how the Trump administration has managed to carry out the least attention-grabbing, but perhaps farthest-reaching, portion of the president's immigration plans: cutting the number of people entering the United States each year as temporary workers or permanent residents.
The administration has put into practice the philosophy President Donald Trump laid out in a pair of executive orders billed as protecting the nation from terrorism and its workers from foreign competition.
One of them, the "Buy American, Hire American" order, singles out the H-1B visa program for skilled workers who otherwise would not be allowed into the country. Hailed by proponents as vital to American innovation, H-1Bs also have been derided as a way to displace U.S. workers with cheaper foreign labor; in one highly publicized case, some Disney employees were told to train their foreign replacements if they wanted severance payments.
Each year, 85,000 H-1Bs, which are valid for three to six years, are available to companies, according to a ceiling set by Congress. Demand far outstrips supply when the economy is healthy, prompting the government to hold a lottery.
But now even applicants lucky enough to be chosen are drawing more scrutiny.
Officials are asking for extra details about applicants' education and work history, the position to be filled and the employer, requiring the company to amass many additional documents, which can postpone a decision by several months.
For H-1Bs, the number of such "requests for evidence" from January to August this year jumped 44 percent compared with the same period last year, according to the most recent data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
So far, the government is still greenlighting most H-1B applications that survive the lottery, but the approval rate is inching down.
For the first two months of this fiscal year, October and November, 86 percent and 82 percent of H-1B applications were approved. That compares with 93 percent and 92 percent for the same months last year. The data does not reflect companies that give up after receiving requests for more evidence.
Once a company has spent thousands of dollars in attorney fees to petition for a worker, "there is huge discouragement after an RFE is issued," said Roxanne Levine, an immigration attorney in New York, "because of the massive extra time, effort and money required to respond."
L. Francis Cissna, the immigration agency's new director, said in an interview that if there are more requests for evidence, "that is perfectly rational and perfectly appropriate."
"We are looking at the entire program to ensure the entire thing is administered well and in conformity with congressional intent," he said.
He recently met with a group of displaced U.S. workers in Florida, including some laid off by Disney. The meeting was arranged by Sara Blackwell, an employment lawyer who leads a group called Protect U.S. Workers. "The administration has done much more for American workers, but I hope to see much more soon," she said.
Still, immigration lawyers and companies seeking the visas say that some of the decisions appear arbitrary.
After responding to requests for evidence, a consulting firm that applied for an H-1B for an energy expert from Britain received a denial stating that the skills for the position "do not appear to be of such complexity, uniqueness or specialization as to require the attainment of a bachelor's degree," a prerequisite for the visa.
Kristen Albertson, the operations manager at the firm, called the outcome "egregious."
"We apply only when it's a strong case and essential to our business," she said of the applicant, who is a graduate of the University of Chicago.
Some lawyers said they had also seen more scrutiny of H-2B visas, the seasonal work permits that Trump uses to staff his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Jeff Joseph, a lawyer in Aurora, Colo., said the government was more often denying visas for companies that sought the visas season after season.
The government's argument, Joseph said, is that those companies are trying to import temporary workers to fill permanent jobs that should go to Americans. But he said his clients faced a shortage of local labor year after year to fill jobs in construction, lodging, landscaping and amusement parks.
Jordan writes for The New York Times.

H-1B visa changes must be done carefully

The Trump administration's plan to consider big changes in the H-1B visa program potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of foreign workers - as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and the McClatchy News Service - must be handled with extreme care, for it could disrupt the U.S. economy.
H-1B visas were created in 1990 to bring in foreign workers with specialized training or a bachelor's degree in the field for which they are being hired in job categories where there are a lack of qualified Americans. The visas expire after three years but are often extended so foreign workers can remain in the United States while pursuing permanent resident status, which can take 10 years or more.
Following through on the president's "Buy American, Hire American" executive order, the Trump administration has begun a process to review whether to limit extensions for H-1B visa holders to promote the hiring of U.S. citizens. 
There are clearly reasons to fine-tune the H-1B process. Contrary to the original intent of the program, there's plenty of evidence that companies are using these visas to hire foreign workers for lower salaries than available qualified Americans - workers who are beholden to their new employers until they gain permanent residency. One egregious case saw Southern California Edison requiring information-technology workers about to be laid off to train their replacements, who had H-1B visas.
But any crackdown on such shabby practices must be pursued with the understanding that many H-1B visa holders are highly talented individuals who play crucial roles in Silicon Valley and the larger tech industry. Pushing them out of America and into tech firms in rival nations at a time of intense economic competition is a self-defeating decision.

Issa's bill to alter H-1B program gains traction

A bill intended to prevent temporary foreign workers from displacing Americans could reach the House floor for a vote in coming months.
The Protect and Grow American Jobs Act, sponsored by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, passed the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote in November, a difficult feat for legislation modifying immigration law. The bill, co-sponsored by Rep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, and Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Alpine, would tweak the H-1B visa program, which grants three-year work visas to skilled workers.
"Unfortunately, loopholes in the program have allowed a small handful of employers to game the system to displace American workers and crowd out others who legitimately need the limited slots available to recruit individuals with unique skill sets not available here at home," Issa said.
Demand for H-1B visas has outnumbered the 85,000 annual cap in recent years. Many of those visas go to employees from large consulting companies with headquarters in India.
Such companies are considered "H-1B dependent"  and have additional requirements when requesting new visas. Issa's bill would heighten those requirements by increasing the minimum salary required for H-1B employees and requiring more extensive reporting about efforts to hire American workers.
The bill also alters the definition of an H-1B dependent company, increasing the percentage of H-1B workers for companies of 50 or more employees to 20 percent from 15 percent.
"Highly skilled individuals that come to America through the H-1B visa program add tremendous value to the U.S. economy," Issa said. "We have a responsibility to ensure this important program isn't being abused by employers to undercut American jobs."
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, objected to a previous version of the bill in 2016 because she didn't think it went far enough to alter the program. Issa incorporated some of her suggestions to reach bipartisan agreement on the bill.

h-4 visa holders fight to keep working

Spouses of foreign workers are taking a stand against the Trump administration's plans to take away their work permits.
H-1B workers' spouses come on H-4 visas. Those are dependent visas, meaning the spouses are not allowed to have jobs in the U.S. Because many get stuck for more than a decade on these temporary visas while they wait for the H-1B holders to become permanent residents, the Obama administration allowed H-4 visa holders who are waiting in long lines for green cards to work while they wait.
The Trump administration, citing the president's "Buy American, Hire American" agenda, announced in the fall of 2017 that it was planning to revoke that permission.
"We're a group of people who want to save our jobs," said Jansi Kumar, who helps organize a group of H-4 work permit holders called Save H4EAD. "It's a little crazy when you wake up one morning and you don't know whether you'll be allowed to work or not."
Because of annual caps on how many visas can go to citizens of one country, people from places like India and China, where many immigrant workers come from, have especially long waits for green cards.
If an employer decides to sponsor a green card for an H-1B employee from India, it can take well over a decade. The people at the front of the line from India for one class of employment visa have been waiting since December 2008, according to the State Department. For another class of visa, they've been waiting since December 2006.
In 2015, the Obama administration put in place a rule that allows spouses of H-1B visa holders to get a work permit after the H-1B visa holder has been accepted into the waiting line for a green card.
The issue mostly affects women, Kumar said.
The government agency that issues visas has approved close to 105,000 work permits for H-4 visa holders since 2015, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. That's just under three percent of the close to 4 million work permits issued by the agency in the same time frame.
Kumar's group did a survey of its members and found that 96 percent have at least a bachelor's degree, and 59 percent have more advanced degrees.
Many of the women who come to the U.S. on H-4 visas pursue additional degrees while they're not allowed to work, she said.
Priyanka Ursal, who came to San Diego in 2010 to live with her husband, said after one year of not working, she ended up applying for a master's program in information system management to have something to do.
"Before that, I had never sat home doing nothing a single day," Ursal said. "It was a hard thing to digest."
Originally from Pune, a city near Mumbai in India, Ursal grew up watching her mother work full time while raising her family. Ursal had similar expectations for herself before an arranged marriage, which are common in India, brought her to the U.S.
She said that first year in San Diego was painful, because she couldn't work.
"There was some guilt in my mind. Am I wasting my time?" she recalled. "I have got a very nice education from a very good school, and I wanted to pursue my career."
After she finished her master's degree, she found a company willing to sponsor her for an H-1B visa.
Her first day back at work was the best day of her life, she said.
"I was so happy, like I could scream to everyone that I am back to life," Ursal said.
When her son was born, she decided to spend some time at home and relinquished her work visa.
At that point, the Obama administration had created the work permit for H-4 visa holders. Since her husband had been in line for a green card since 2011, she knew she'd be able to return to work when she was ready.
She found a job working as a senior test engineer at a startup. She and her husband are saving to buy a house.
She wants to set an example for her son as a working mother, and the job helps her pay for his day care.
"This job does not just mean money for me, but it is also my identity, my pride and my self-esteem," Ursal said.
She hasn't talked to her co-workers about her situation because she's waiting to see the Trump administration's final rule.
The proposed rule was supposed to be published to the Federal Register in February. The administration announced on Thursday that it will now wait until June.
Sangeeta Degalmadikar, who came to the U.S. with her husband in 2008, has her own fashion design company that she started last year.
She's worried about what will happen to her business, and to her employee, if she loses her work permit.
"It was my dream to have my business and to achieve something," Degalmadikar said. "In India, I was a professional. After coming here, everything for me was blank."
She had plans to expand to an online store and possibly a storefront, but she's decided to hold off. She encouraged her employee to drop to part time with her and find other work to protect the employee from unemployment if Degalmadikar no longer has a way to run the business legally.
Sheetal Bangalore Srikumar, who lives in Poway, said that the uncertainty she's facing while waiting for the administration's decision has made it difficult to plan her family's future.
An engineer, she came to the U.S. in 2008, first on a student visa for a master's degree and then found a company to sponsor an H-1B visa for her.
Her husband was working in San Diego when they married. They couldn't find two H-1B sponsored jobs in the same city, so their lives involved many long commutes and a lot of time in separate cities.
In 2013, they got in the waiting line for green cards. When the Obama administration introduced the H-4 work permit, Bangalore Srikumar quit her H-1B job and moved to San Diego to be with her husband.
"In this century, canceling the whole work authorization for women, it doesn't make any sense," she said. "It goes back to the olden days when women were not allowed to work."
She emphasized that H-4 workers pay taxes and want to contribute economically.
"We want to work," Bangalore Srikumar said. "After studying, after doing everything, you don't want to sit at home."

Local Congress members' collegiality unlike in Washington

Give this to San Diego's congressional delegation: The members may be divided along partisan lines on big-picture issues, but they're rather civil about it.
When they get together back here to discuss their views, disagreements and collaborations, it seems San Diego is light-years away from Washington, D.C., not a mere 2,200 or so miles.
They are knowledgeable, humorous, collegial and on occasion show a genuine affection for working with one another.
But that's not new to anyone who has attended the annual San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce Congressional Luncheon, and the one held Friday at the downtown Omni hotel held true to form.
At times it was hard to believe they belong to the same Congress that is seen as a bitterly partisan, divided, angry and often dysfunctional body.
Present Friday were Democrats Susan Davis, Scott Peters, Juan Vargas and Republican Darrell Issa. Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter couldn't make it, but when he has been present, the vibe is similar, as it was last year when all five were in attendance.
Differences aside on the volatile national issues of the day, the delegation has long been lauded for pulling together on important local issues, such as their successful efforts to win massive funding to improve border crossings - and expedite commerce - with Mexico.
The moderator underscored that as she opened the Q&A session with the four representatives. Members of San Diego's congressional delegation "understand the power of collaboration," said Monica Rodriguez, senior director of governmental affairs for Qualcomm.
"I'd love to see Congress work as well as San Diego does," Davis said, referring to the local delegation.
To a person, they said there are good personal relationships in Congress across the aisle - Davis noted this was particularly the case among women, in her view - and that bipartisan coalitions can be cobbled together on specific projects.
Peters said some important progress doesn't get much attention, particularly on issues affecting veterans and commerce.
"I think there's a lot getting done maybe under the radar," said Peters, who sits on panels that deal with both areas.
The members expressed frustration with not only the leadership of the opposing party, but sometimes their own - particularly on the failure to enact comprehensive immigration reform. They didn't dwell on the differences among themselves.
"That dialogue hasn't gone on on either side of the aisle," Issa said.
"Both sides are at fault here," said Vargas, adding that Democrats couldn't move the ball forward when they were in control.
Peters sounded a bit angry about a sweeping immigration bill that got out of the Senate five years ago but collapsed when Republican leaders did not allow a vote in the House.
Issa had a similar tone when he mentioned a bill to reform rules on H-1B visas for specialty workers such as those sought by technology industries. The measure had bipartisan support - the entire San Diego delegation was on board and it cleared the House Judiciary Committee. But it never got a floor vote.
"That irritates all of us," Issa said.
Asked about the potential for impeachment proceedings against Trump if Democrats take over the House, none of the three San Diego party members said it would be a good idea simply because they gained the majority. Barring some legal reason to act, they said Democrats should focus on flipping the White House in 2020.
On trade policy, Issa didn't defend Trump's bludgeoning approach, but he agreed with the administration that the United States was being hurt by unfair practices by China, the European Union and Canada.
Davis objected to how Trump has dealt with Mexico and Canada, saying the U.S. neighbors deserved reasonable if tough negotiations.
Vargas said a trade war wouldn't do the U.S. any good, but said the country was not being treated fairly by some major trade partners.
"It's not what we do, it's how we do it," said Issa. He then said to Vargas, "Is that a fair assessment?"
"Yeah, that's probably not bad," Vargas responded.
Peters got a hearty laugh from the crowd about one idea to move the ball forward on trade: "I think we should name the Trans Pacific Partnership the Trump Pacific Partnership and give him credit."
The session was devoid of the kind of rancor Issa has faced from the anti-Trump resistance that helped push him to retire from Congress when his current term ends. It was just the opposite. As the delegation looks ahead to the new congressional year, Vargas said, they will feel the loss of Issa. "He always comes through."
The patter between Vargas and Issa at times seemed as if they were auditioning for a buddy movie - lots of good times and jokes. The audience ate it up.
"Juan is willing to travel with me and eat things he never thought he would eat, in places he thought he never wanted to go," Issa said. "So, when you need to go places to see things, you take Juan. It's kind of a bonding experience."
"He's much nicer than everybody thinks," Vargas replied, eliciting a roar from the crowd. "He's actually a good guy."

Local Congress members' collegiality unlike in Washington

Give this to San Diego's congressional delegation: The members may be divided along partisan lines on big-picture issues, but they're rather civil about it.
When they get together back here to discuss their views, disagreements and collaborations, it seems San Diego is light-years away from Washington, D.C., not a mere 2,200 or so miles.
They are knowledgeable, humorous, collegial and on occasion show a genuine affection for working with one another.
But that's not new to anyone who has attended the annual San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce Congressional Luncheon, and the one held Friday at the downtown Omni hotel held true to form.
At times it was hard to believe they belong to the same Congress that is seen as a bitterly partisan, divided, angry and often dysfunctional body.
Present Friday were Democrats Susan Davis, Scott Peters, Juan Vargas and Republican Darrell Issa. Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter couldn't make it, but when he has been present, the vibe is similar, as it was last year when all five were in attendance.
Differences aside on the volatile national issues of the day, the delegation has long been lauded for pulling together on important local issues, such as their successful efforts to win massive funding to improve border crossings - and expedite commerce - with Mexico.
The moderator underscored that as she opened the question-and-answer session with the four representatives. Members of San Diego's congressional delegation "understand the power of collaboration," said Monica Rodriguez, senior director of governmental affairs for Qualcomm.
"I'd love to see Congress work as well as San Diego does," Davis said, referring to the local delegation.
To a person, they said there are good personal relationships in Congress across the aisle - Davis noted this was particularly the case among women, in her view - and that bipartisan coalitions can be cobbled together on specific projects.
Peters said some important progress doesn't get much attention, particularly on issues affecting veterans and commerce.
"I think there's a lot getting done maybe under the radar," said Peters, who sits on panels that deal with both areas.
The members expressed frustration with not only the leadership of the opposing party, but sometimes their own - particularly on the failure to enact comprehensive immigration reform. They didn't dwell on the differences among themselves.

Study links foreign hires to increased innovation

Hiring foreign-born workers can increase a company's innovation, according to a new study from UC San Diego, leading to benefits for consumers in terms of product quality and selection.
The working paper found that a 10 percent increase in the share of a company's workers on H-1B visas - temporary work visas that last three to six years - increases innovation by 2 percent the next year. The study measures innovation using product reallocation, the rate of new products replacing old, obsolete products.
To put that impact into context, the last recession decreased that kind of innovation by 9 percent, said Gaurav Khanna, an assistant professor of economics at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at UC San Diego and one of the authors of the study.
H-1B workers must have at least a bachelor's degree and be petitioned by a specific employer.
A maximum of 85,000 visas are given out each year. There are usually more applications than can get visas under the cap.
Politicians including Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista, and Rep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, have tried to add restrictions to the program in recent years out of concern that some companies hire H-1B workers at lower salaries than their American counterparts would have received.
H-1B visa holders work on a range of products including laptops, pharmaceuticals and soft drinks, Khanna said.
"It means that consumers like you and me when we go into the store we have newer products, higher quality products, and more variety of products," Khanna said.
That may sound like a small impact for an individual consumer, Khanna said, but when he looks at the size of consumer groups, the impact on the economy is significant.
It took about a year for Khanna and his collaborator Munseob Lee, also an assistant professor of economics at UC San Diego, to analyze 10 years of nationwide H-1B worker and product data.
Their findings, he said, line up with other studies that have looked at how H-1B workers affect how many patents a company gets, another way to measure innovation.

Highlight: Businesses say increased red tape has made it harder to secure employment-based visas, which has added to the difficulty of finding qualified workers.JASON HENRY NYT
Body


The Trump administration is using the country's vast and nearly opaque immigration bureaucracy to constrict the flow of foreign workers into the United States by throwing up new roadblocks to limit legal arrivals.
The government is denying more work visas, asking applicants to provide additional information and delaying approvals more frequently than just a year earlier. Hospitals, hotels, technology companies and other businesses say they are now struggling to fill jobs with the foreign workers they need.
With foreign hires missing, the employees who remain are being forced to pick up the slack. Seasonal industries like hotels and landscaping are having to turn down customers or provide fewer services. Corporate executives worry about the long-term impact of losing talented engineers and programmers to countries like Canada.
At Northwell Health's pathology lab on Long Island, a new doctor's cubicle stands empty, her computer and microscope untouched. Other residents started July 1, but she is stuck in India's Punjab state, held up by unexplained delays in her visa.
In April 2017, President Donald Trump signed a "Buy American and Hire American" executive order, directing government officials to "rigorously enforce" immigration laws.
A few months later, the president endorsed legislation that would cut legal immigration by half. The bill was introduced by two Republican senators, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia. But Republican leaders in Congress have not advanced it.
Some lawmakers say Trump is using administrative means to reshape immigration policy because those changes have stalled on Capitol Hill.
In practice, businesses say the increased red tape has made it harder to secure employment-based visas.
A recent analysis of government data by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, found that the denial rate for H-1B visa petitions for skilled foreign workers had increased 41 percent in the last three months of the 2017 fiscal year, compared with the third quarter.
In a statement, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said the administration was "relentlessly pursuing necessary immigration reforms that move toward a merit-based system." It added that all petitions and applications were handled "fairly, efficiently, and effectively on a case-by-case basis."
Experts say a sustained reduction in immigration could dampen growth over time as more baby boomers retire, leaving big gaps in the job market.
That goes for high-skilled immigrants and low-skilled workers, said Francine Blau, an economist at Cornell. The latter will be vital in fields like elder care and child care, as well as construction and cleaning.
"A lot of our labor-force growth comes from immigrants and their children," Blau said. "Without them, we'd suffer the problems associated with countries with an aging population, like Japan."
The Business Roundtable, a group of corporate leaders, recently challenged the Trump administration over changes that it says threaten the livelihoods of thousands of skilled foreign workers, and economic growth and competitiveness.

H-1B proposal would streamline registration
U.S. Government

The federal government has proposed requiring people planning to apply for temporary work visas to register online beforehand.
The change would cut costs for those hoping to apply for H-1B visas as well as reduce the amount of paperwork handled by the federal agency responsible for processing applications, according to the proposed rule posted in the Federal Register, because in recent years the number of people applying has far exceeded the number of H-1B visas awarded.
The H-1B program provides three-year work permits that may be renewed once and has an annual cap of 65,000 visas with an extra 20,000 specifically for those with U.S. advanced degrees.
Currently, companies have a five-day window to submit paper applications for prospective employees. Under the rule, the federal government would notify online registrants if they were selected to apply for a visa, and only then would they need to submit all of the paperwork and the filing fee.
Kathleen Spero, immigration attorney at San Diego firm Jacobs and Schlesinger, said she thinks the change will streamline what has been a difficult system for employers to navigate when they want to hire someone from overseas.
What concerns her, she said, is that the government plans to implement the rule within a matter of months, which will involve building a functional registration system to use by next spring. The application window typically begins April 1.
If the government doesn't get the registration program operational in time, attorneys may have to scramble to submit full applications under the old system.
"This is the kind of thing you would expect the government to implement in May or in June," Spero said. "They're giving themselves two-and-a-half months to create a brand-new program. If they don't implement it, the people who are going to have to bear the burden are not the government but the people submitting applications."
The rule would also change the order in which applications are selected to give more preference to those with U.S. master's degrees, according to the proposed rule
Members of the public wishing to comment on the proposed rule can do so by Jan. 2, 2019.

Tech workers struggle to get H-1B visas under Trump
Process has become more onerous and murky, applicants say

Highlight: Leo Wang, shown at the IRS office in San Jose, says of H-1B visas: "There seems to be a crack in the system, and I happen to be the one who fell through." Leo Wang, whose H-1B visa was denied more than eight months after Citizenship and Immigration Services started reviewing his application, packs his belongings at his home last week in San Jose to leave the country. President Donald Trump, speaking at Snap-on in Kenosha, Wis., in 2017, later signed an order to make changes to a visa program that brings in high-skilled workers.Josh Edelson For The Los Angeles Times Josh Edelson For The Los Angeles Times Susan Walsh AP file
Body


Leo Wang thought a promising career in the United States was within his grasp. After leaving home in China in 2015, he earned a graduate degree in entrepreneurship and innovation at the University of Southern California and was hired at a Silicon Valley data storage company.
But after his first year on the job, Wang, 32, found himself hunched over his laptop, obsessively refreshing the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. He was hoping for good news.
It was last October, six months since he'd applied for an H-1B work visa for high-skilled employees. He'd waited so long for a response that his extended student visa had expired and his employer was forced to place him on unpaid administrative leave.
When still no response had come from the government agency by New Year's Eve, the company had to fire him.
"I've never felt so helpless," he said. "I came here, all the way to a place where I don't know anybody, in hopes of fighting for my American dream. There seems to be a crack in the system, and I happen to be the one who fell through."
But Wang isn't alone. Many tech workers say the process of applying for and getting H-1B visas has become increasingly murky and difficult under President Donald Trump's administration. While many people zero in on Trump's crackdown against illegal immigration, his administration has also tightened or ended various paths to legal immigration.
Experts say changes to the application process for H-1B visas could discourage high-skilled workers from seeking employment in the U.S. The changes, including heightened requirements for evidence showing that a foreign worker possesses exceptional qualifications and the temporary suspension of "premium processing," which fast-tracks applications for a $1,500 fee, have resulted in a backlog of applications.
A process that could have taken two weeks has taken several months for many of those who filed petitions in the last year. Students and current tech industry employees are left in limbo, uncertain of whether they'll be allowed to remain in the U.S.
Last month, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) released an analysis of Citizenship and Immigration Services data showing significant delays in the agency's processing of applications for various immigration benefits. AILA found that overall case processing times have increased by 46 percent over the last two fiscal years and 91 percent since 2014. It also found that processing times increased last year even as fewer people submitted applications.
AILA Vice President Jennifer Minear said the delays have reached a crisis level and are the result of policies that inhibit efficiency and act as "bricks in the Trump administration's invisible wall against legal immigration."
Last month, Citizenship and Immigration Services reinstated premium processing for all applications from the last fiscal year. "We plan to resume premium processing for the remaining categories of H-1B petitions as agency workloads permit," the agency said in a notice posted on its website.
Still, immigration lawyers say that lifting the suspension will only partially address the delays in processing petitions, some of which have gone unanswered for nine months.
William Stock, an immigration lawyer in Philadelphia and former president of AILA, said that processing times of more than six months used to be rare. Then Citizenship and Immigration Services ramped up requests for proof that companies needed foreign workers. Nearly half of the 200 H-1B applications submitted by his law firm received those requests last year.
"The immigration agency is creating more work for themselves - and then they say they're falling behind," he said, adding that some of the businesses he represents have been forced to relocate jobs to places such as Canada and India.
Other lawyers agree.
"Given the immigration climate, we can anticipate a significant denial rate when all of these long-backlogged adjudications resolve," said David Berry, a partner at immigration law firm BAL Global, which has represented companies such as Google.
Companies use H-1B visas to temporarily employ foreign workers for jobs that require specialized knowledge when they can't find the talent locally. In 1990, Congress set an annual limit of 85,000 such visas, 20,000 of which go to people who have earned a master's degree or higher in the U.S.
Last year, Citizenship and Immigration Services received more than 190,000 applications, down from a high of 236,000 the year before Trump took office. When the limit is exceeded within the first week that applications are accepted, the agency randomly selects those it will ultimately review.
The agency currently selects applicants to fill the advanced degree requirement first, then fills the remaining openings. But starting in April, the agency plans to reverse the order, estimating that the change will result in a 16 percent increase of beneficiaries with advanced degrees.
Citizenship and Immigration Services Director L. Francis Cissna said the changes benefit employers, foreign workers and the agency's adjudicators alike. "We are also furthering President Trump's goal of improving our immigration system by making a simple adjustment to the H-1B cap selection process," he said.
Trump's "Buy American and Hire American" initiative, unveiled in 2017, brought scrutiny to the H-1B program.
At the time, Trump said: "Right now, widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing American workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries to fill the same job for sometimes less pay. This will stop."
Earlier this year, the president shifted tone. "H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship," he said on Twitter. "We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S."
Tech companies employ some of the highest numbers of H-1B workers, according to 2017 data from Citizenship and Immigration Services. As of September 2017, more than 360,000 applications for new H-1B visas and extensions or transfers of existing visas were approved in the U.S. across all industries.
In 2017, 74 percent of all H-1B applications were approved, down from 87 percent the year before and the lowest approval rate in at least a decade.
Companies such as Cognizant Tech Solutions and Infosys topped the list of biggest employers of H-1B workers, with about 28,000 and 13,000 applications approved, respectively. Amazon was approved for about 4,800 such visas, Microsoft received 4,000 and Google and Intel each were allotted nearly 3,000.
Facebook, which had about 1,600 applications approved in 2017, said the company is continuing to sponsor H-1B workers in spite of the increased difficulty.
"We are feeling the same challenges as other companies, but our commitment to hire the best talent remains strong, and we continue to have success with our H-1B visa applications," Facebook spokesman Anthony Harrison said.
But in some cases, tech companies have opted not to consider potential candidates who would require an H-1B visa to work in the U.S. until there's more clarity about whether the suspension of premium processing will be lifted indefinitely.
Together, these changes have caused some immigrants who graduated from college in the U.S. to reject job offers, lose their jobs or ultimately leave the country as a result of the long delays in processing. Some say they have opted to or are considering a move to Canada, where the path to obtain work permits and eventually citizenship is typically more straightforward and quicker.
The path to citizenship for H-1B recipients also remains rocky. A bill hailed by many H-1B workers from India as the only chance at mending the many cracks in the path to citizenship was stalled in Congress last session. 
The bill is now tied up in the Department of Homeland Security budget at the center of the government shutdown debate. The bipartisan bill, HR 392, would have benefited workers from places such as India and China that have a backlog of green card applicants that spans decades by making the green card system first come, first served rather than country-based, some workers contend.
"I will die before I get my green card," said Varun Soundararajan, a senior software engineer who was born in India and works at Google. "Many folks like me on the green card line are praying that when the new Congress starts functioning, the bill will be reintroduced and will pass and get signed into law."
Without a green card, Soundararajan and many like him are subject to the uncertainty of reapplying for H-1B visas every three years. As the father of a child with special needs, it's a matter of grave concern for him and his wife, because leaving the country would make it difficult to access the care and resources needed to take care of their son.
"(His) care would be in serious jeopardy if my visa is denied," Soundararajan said of his son. "There are no guarantees that I will get my visa next time I apply."
The delays in processing H-1Bs paired with the backlog of green card applications from Indian and Chinese citizens also make it incredibly risky to try to switch jobs. Because of the delays in processing applications, there's little guarantee that the petition to transfer an H-1B visa will be approved or approved in time. 
Even if it is approved, workers from those countries have to restart the green card application process, which puts them at the back of the decades-long line again. 
As a result, workers often feel stuck at their current company, sometimes in a situation where they are being underpaid or mistreated.
Still, Chinese and Indian citizens make up the majority of H-1B workers nationwide. As of October 2018, nearly 75 percent of all H-1B petitions were filed on behalf of Indian-born immigrants and 12 percent were filed on behalf of Chinese-born immigrants.
"Any change to the H-1B system disproportionately affects Indian and Chinese immigrants because we are stuck on that H-1B visa," said another software engineer at Google, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussion. "I have multiple classmates from UCLA who joined the green card line years after I did and are already filing for citizenship whereas I'm still on the H-1B visa, which took seven months for me to get. They get a green card roughly within a year."
Back in San Jose, Wang finally got a response from Citizenship and Immigration Services - more than eight months after the agency started reviewing his application - in early January. It was denied.
According to Citizenship and Immigration Services documents, his role as a program manager - for which he led analytics programs, built dashboards and created statistical testing models that spanned the company's global marketing operations - was not specialized enough. 
Wang spoke to The Times on condition that we not name his past employer.
Records show the company was granted 85 visas in 2017, including two for Wang's same job title, and denied one.
"People under the same team as me got approval," he said. "It doesn't feel like there's a standard for the judgment call. It seems a little bit arbitrary."
What once felt like the beginning of a promising career in the U.S. became a nightmare for Wang, who plans to leave the country by mid-February.
He said the long process made him feel ashamed. He waited as friends and colleagues' applications were approved and told few people about his predicament, giving his mother vague answers when she asked how work was going. He spent the three months he was on administrative leave at home, living off savings.
Now he's searching for jobs - in Singapore, mainland China and Hong Kong - and planning to sell his car and other belongings.
Wang wants his story to serve as a cautionary tale to other H-1B applicants about the program's recent complications.
"I followed the rules and worked hard," he said. "It didn't work for me."

Gun show ban will not solve any problems
Re "Gloria introduces bill that would end gun show at Del Mar Fairgrounds" (Feb. 22): I totally disagree with Assemblyman Todd Gloria's bill banning gun shows at the Del Mar Fairgrounds. It would punish lawful small businesses and law-abiding gun owners, and do nothing to make our schools and communities safer. I am all for common-sense gun laws, but this ban makes no sense.
Charles Lackey
Carlsbad
Todd Gloria's attempt to end gun shows at the Del Mar Fairgrounds is reported using inaccurate terms that spin the issues involved. For example, NeverAgainCa.org is not a gun "safety" organization. It is more correctly a gun control by abolition group. Its founder's public statements have repeatedly proven so. The word "scrutiny" is used to imply that law enforcement has been suspicious of show operations for 30 years. Untrue. Firearms sales are the most heavily regulated, by both federal and state laws, in the nation. Crossroads shows are conducted in full compliance with those regulations. There are no reported cases of illegal sales having occurred at them.
Gloria would do well to remember that legislators do best when they create legislation based solely on actual facts. Law based on intentional, or ill-informed, distortions may serve a political career but not the long-term public good.

Voters won't dump cars for bikes, mass transit
Re "Fletcher explains push for drop in driving" (Feb. 25): Nathan Fletcher is the worst kind of politician, the kind who likes to spend other people's money.

Del Mar gets special treatment on tracks
Re "Stabilizing tracks a top priority" (Feb. 24): Ongoing and future bluff stabilization projects are important stopgap measures until more permanent solutions, including double tracks, are approved and constructed. However, the only alternatives seriously proposed are multibillion-dollar tunneling options that would avoid impacting expensive cliffside real estate just east of the tracks.
Acquisition of land for right of way must occur at fair market value whether purchased or subject to condemnation. Doing so, and excavating much further back into the cliff faces, may or may not be less expensive and disruptive than tunnel alternatives. 
Depending on geological and engineering concerns, it may or may not be feasible. But to not consider this alternative will lead to claims, legitimate or not, of an environmental justice issue because if Del Mar were a barrio or ghetto, right of way acquisition along the cliffs would have surely been considered.

Give all those jobs to military supporters
So 9,000 Google and 50 Apple employees sign petitions because they don't want to support the defense industry. That sounds like a great opportunity to lay off 9,050 employees and revoke a few H-1B visas. 
I'm sure there are at least 9,050 veterans who would work 60 hours a week for $150,000 a year. The laid-off employees can apply for jobs in North Korea, Syria or Saudi Arabia. The women employees may change their minds after a few months in Saudi Arabia. I might also suggest not signing any petitions there.

Democrats losing votes over abortion issue
Re "Democrats block abortion bill in Senate" (Feb. 26): I never believed I would see the day when we would kill a child born alive. This Page 4 article should have been a front-page headline. 
I remember President Kennedy's inaugural address in 1961 when he said what it meant to be an American. He talked about God's role in our lives, our service to others and our personal accountability. Everybody was so proud to be a Democrat.
Nearly 60 years later, all our Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate voted for infanticide. I'm embarrassed to be a Democrat.

GOP seems to only care about unborn children
In an effort to curtail women's reproductive rights, Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has started to rattle his anti-abortion saber once again.
This is curious because House Republicans tried but failed to pass more than $20 billion in cuts to food stamps that would have eliminated free school lunches for thousands of low-income children.
In McConnell's blind quest to save the fetus, he has forsaken the child.

Sickening to see Trump fawn over Kim Jong Un
Re "Trump, Kim arrive in Vietnam" (Feb. 27): "My friend Kim Jong Un," "we fell in love," "he wrote me beautiful letters." Those were the words of a U.S. president about a brutal dictator who has murdered hundreds, if not thousands, including his own half-brother, and lets his people starve while he builds nuclear weapons and parades a million-man army. 
To see Kim basking in the limelight of being elevated to the level of an international statesman by Trump is sickening. Trump's craving for adulation at any price is a disgrace, danger and embarrassment to this country, and rises to the level of insanity. When will Republicans show the backbone to actually stand up for the very things the party once stood for, honesty, decency and human rights?

Shame on Democrats for undermining Trump
Re "Cohen alleges Trump crimes" (Feb. 28): The date Feb. 27, 2019, should go down in history as the day the Democratic Party ceased to exist as a bastion of American democracy.
The pathetic charade played out in Washington, D.C. with the Judas, Michael Cohen, trying to bring down the president of the United States was completely overshadowed by the efforts of the president to establish a peaceful Korea and an opportunity for our former enemy to become a thriving nation for its people. 
Add to that Democrats voting for infanticide earlier in the week and it should sound the knell of the Democratic Party's death throes.

April 1 is the first day employers may file petitions with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for H-1B visas for the upcoming fiscal year.
According to the agency's announcement of the start of H-1B season, "The H-1B program allows companies in the United States to temporarily employ foreign workers in occupations that require the application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or higher in the specific specialty, or its equivalent. Congress has set a cap of 65,000 H-1B visas per fiscal year. An advanced degree exemption from the H-1B cap is available for 20,000 beneficiaries who have earned a U.S. master's degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher education." 
A B-1 visa, by contrast, has no numerical cap and is far less expensive to obtain than an H-1B visa. Such a visa may be issued to a nonimmigrant entering the U.S. temporarily for business activities other than gainful employment in this country, such as for conferences. 
It is easier and cheaper to qualify for an uncapped B-1 visa than a capped H-1B visa. Yet the Foreign Affairs Manual issued by the U.S. State Department acknowledges "[i]t can be difficult to distinguish between appropriate B1 business activities, and activities that constitute skilled or unskilled labor in the United States that are not appropriate on B status." 
San Jose federal judge Lucy Koh addressed this very conundrum in March in reviewing a False Claims Act lawsuit alleging that it was an abuse of the B-1 program, depriving the federal government of the higher H-1B fees, for Apple to pay India-based outsourcing company Infosys Technologies to have two Infosys Indian trainers with B-1 visas provide live software training to Apple employees in California. The suit was brought by Carl Krawitt, an American who worked at Apple as an independent contractor for Infosys. He allegedly alerted managers at both companies of his concerns they were misusing the B-1 program and sued when those concerns were unheeded. 
In dismissing the lawsuit, Judge Koh concluded that the training the Indian nationals provided constituted business activity covered under the B-1 program. She applied a three-part test developed by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Under that test, a B-1 visa is appropriate if: (1) the visitor clearly intends to remain a foreign resident; (2) a foreign country is the visitor's principal place of business and where the business generates most of its profit; and (3) the visitor's entry is clearly temporary. 
There was no dispute about the first and third parts of the test. Judge Koh found that the training satisfied the second part of the test because both Infosys and the trainers were based in India and because Apple's payment for the training did not go to the trainers for their work in California, but went instead to Infosys, which in turn paid the trainers in India. 
Judge Koh further observed that allowing the India-based Infosys trainers to train American-based Apple employees under the B-1 program furthered Congress' intent to protect American workers. "Training American workers presumably enhances their employment opportunities in the United States, and thus protects them from unnecessary foreign competition." 
Judge Koh alternatively held that, even if the trainers were improperly admitted to the U.S. under the B-1 visa program, Apple and Infosys could not have violated the False Claims Act because that law requires the alleged offenders to have had "actual knowledge" that they were making a false claim of entitlement to the program or to have acted with "deliberate ignorance" or "reckless disregard." 
The ambiguity in the allowable uses of B-1 visas worked in Apple and Infosys' favor. "Apple and Infosys cannot be charged with knowledge or willful blindness to the correct uses of the B-1 visa because there is simply no exhaustive list or case law of all permissible activities under a B-1 visa" or any legal authority saying that providing training is impermissible under a B-1 visa. Krawitt's warnings to company officials were not enough because, said Judge Koh, he is not an "authoritative source" on the interpretation of U.S. visa policy.
To say the contours of the B-1 program are inexact is not to say they are nonexistent. American businesses test the boundaries of this program at their own risk.

No, Mr. President, the U.S. is far from 'full'

In late March, on a day President Donald Trump again threatened to close the southern border, the Department of Homeland Security nearly doubled the number of H-2B seasonal employment visas available to foreign workers this summer - adding 30,000 to 33,000 already planned. A week later, at the California border, he told migrants that the United States "can't take you anymore. Our country is full."
Yes, additional visas will go only to returning H-2B workers who have worked in the U.S. in the past three years. But the Trump administration's decision to offer more of these seasonal visas than they have in past years - in non-agriculture blue-collar positions, often in the visitor industry - shows the nation isn't "full." Employers' demand is so great that they had submitted requests for nearly 100,000 workers five minutes after they could do so, crashing the system, per The Boston Globe. By law, these visas can only be granted when "there are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified and available to do the temporary work," according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
Full? With unemployment and births at or near record lows, the U.S. economy needs workers in many fields. Trump defenders will say he's making a distinction between those who seek to enter the nation legally with a visa and those who don't. But the president's history hardly suggests any nuance on immigration. He's routinely depicted all immigrants - legal and unauthorized, highly skilled and less skilled - as net negatives for America. 
And Trump has followed up on his rhetoric. In April 2017, he issued his "Buy American and Hire American" executive order that has made it more difficult for employers to hire and retain H-1B workers - foreigners with specialized skills who have helped fill crucial gaps at every U.S. tech hub.
The president is likely to keep railing against those who enter the nation without authorization and legal asylum seekers alike. But his administration's H-2B decision and his unexpectedly effusive January tweet about the "talented and highly skilled people" who use H-1B visas show he realizes immigration is more complex than he lets on.
Those who have figured this out include a bipartisan group of 11 senators who sent a letter to the Trump administration urging it to increase the number of allowed H-2B visas to 135,200. They said the goal of their letter was "to convey the reality that a serious labor shortage confronts our country."
Such a shortage is a profound threat to the economic growth that is Trump's strongest card in seeking re-election. The easiest way to address this is by encouraging women with children and the elderly to return to the work force, as Japan has done.
But Japan has also abandoned its taboos on foreign workers, allowing skilled professionals to get permanent resident status after just one year. This points to the ultimate solution to the worker shortage. It's comprehensive immigration reform - an omnibus measure that includes expanded visa programs, a provision like Japan's to attract talented workers, border security improvements and creation of a path to citizenship for productive immigrants who have long lived in the United States.
Populist Trump who calls some immigrants "animals" may not want to admit this. But businessman Trump who said he regularly hired hundreds of foreign workers for his Mar-a-Lago club because "getting help in Palm Beach during the season is almost impossible" should want to admit it. The problem extends far beyond fancy Florida resorts.

Trump's immigration plan offers a lot to like

Most of President Donald Trump's immigration policies and initiatives have been both harsh and ill-advised. From his policy of separating migrant adults and children at the border to his reduced acceptance of refugees to his encouragement of more aggressive tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Trump has needlessly targeted the most vulnerable people trying to get into the country. Meanwhile, various Trump administration initiatives have made life harder for H-1B visa applicants and holders, immigrant entrepreneurs, overseas students and immigrants serving in the U.S. military. Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on a vow to limit immigration to the U.S., seems to be doing his best to keep that promise.
However, so far, Trump has been nibbling around the edges, unable to touch the main pillar of U.S. immigration - the green-card system. In 2017, the U.S. granted more than a million lawful permanent residencies, a number little changed from recent years.
Although Trump can try to limit this number via administrative measures, changing it substantively would probably require an act of Congress. In 2017, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and David Perdue introduced a bill that would have cut immigration levels by half, but it didn't pass. Now, with Democrats in control of the House of Representatives, getting such legislation through both houses of Congress seems even more remote. The core of the U.S. immigration system looks likely to remain intact.
But Trump recently released another proposal for reforming legal immigration that deserves some consideration. Designed by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the bill wouldn't reduce overall legal immigration levels; instead, it would shift green cards away from family sponsorship and the lottery now used to ensure geographical diversity and toward skills-based immigration. It would also include measures for increased border security, including Trump's long-sought border wall.
The idea of shifting to a more merit-based legal immigration system is a good one. Because the American public as a whole demands some sort of numerical limit on immigration, it's probably good to make sure a high percentage of those immigrants have employable skills that will allow them to thrive in the U.S., and to help the U.S. maintain its technological dominance. Skilled immigrants also tend to come with big fiscal benefits for cash-strapped local and state governments.
Emigrants also tend to be a boon for their native countries, since families often transfer capital and knowledge back, and since education levels often rise in those countries to compensate for the outflow of degree holders.
Trump's proposal is vague but promises to bring the skilled percentage up to 57%, while reducing the family percent to 33%. If done right, that would be good. The current system isn't bad - education levels of U.S. immigrants have risen in recent years on their own. But Canada's system works great, and the U.S. might as well copy its success. Skilled immigration is also popular with the U.S. public.
Some will surely leap to defend the present system. But there's no deep moral reason the U.S. system is so heavily tilted toward family sponsorship, which is largely an accident of history. In 1965, when the outlines of the current immigration system were put in place, Rep. Michael Feighan of Ohio was worried the new law would lead to too much non-white immigration. So he insisted on increasing the percentage of slots for family sponsorship, reasoning they would mostly go to the European family members of white Americans. Of course, things didn't turn out that way. But it's important to remember the U.S.'s family-focused system is the result of a policy that was racist by design.
Although the basic idea of a more skills-based system is a good one, the devil is in the details. Most family-based immigrants to the U.S. - about two-thirds - are the immediate family of U.S. citizens, and who are thus not covered under the quota system put in place in 1965. If the Trump-Kushner plan would bring citizens' immediate family members under the quota system, then it should be regarded as a nonstarter. Also, preventing permanent residents from bringing their own spouses and children over, as some predict the plan will do, would be a very bad change. Limitation of family sponsorship immigration should be done only by reducing the number of visas allocated toward siblings and adult children.
So instead of rejecting Trump and Kushner's plan, Democrats should give it a fair hearing. If the details of the plan are reasonable, the Democrats should consider cutting a deal - relief for undocumented immigrants facing deportation, and a path to citizenship, in exchange for border security and a rebalancing of legal immigration toward merit and skills. That deal, which would be similar to a broad immigration reform proposed in the Senate in 2013, would have the potential to make the U.S. system better for the next century.

Coder shortage? Let's get rid of a bunch

With the U.S. tech economy booming, many companies in Silicon Valley, San Francisco and California's other tech hubs have struggled to find qualified workers. But they've benefited greatly from a 2008 decision by the George W. Bush administration to increase to three years the amount of time that foreign students and graduates of U.S. schools can work in tech jobs without getting an H-1B visa.
Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican who represents a mostly rural Arizona district that will never be mistaken for a tech hub, thinks this is a bad thing. He's introduced the Fairness for High-Skilled Americans Act of 2019 to scrap this program. Gosar is also calling on President Donald Trump to use an executive order to immediately implement his proposal.
Yes, several U.S. firms are credibly accused of relying on foreign workers to hold down wages. But given that there are now 500,000-plus unfilled computing jobs in the nation - and that this number is expected to more than double by 2026 - Gosar's bill is nonsensical. His case is so weak that his only conceivable motive is to send the message to his constituents that he really, really doesn't like foreigners.
If Gosar - or Trump - want to be constructive on this issue, they would seek to condition some federal education grants to states on availability of computer science programs. In 2020, it's absurd that 65% of high schools have no such classes.

A Conversation with Congressman Scott Peters
Scott Peters was first elected to Congress in 2012. He is a former environmental lawyer who served on the San Diego City Council and became the city's first City Council president. Peters represents California's 52nd Congressional District, which includes the cities of Coronado, Poway and most of northern San Diego.

ABBY: We're going to talk to you about a lot of things. We want to start right away by asking you where you stand on impeachment.
PETERS: I, like all the elected officials, particularly Democrats... we were all saying well, we have to wait to see what's in the Mueller report and now we can't say that anymore. We can see the Mueller report and it outlines some pretty serious stuff. It establishes that we were attacked by Russia in a way much more serious than a few guys going through some Democrats' file cabinets in 1972 in the Watergate Hotel. This is a former adversary who attacked us. And, although there was not a crime of conspiracy, there's certainly a lot of cooperation by the Trump people. 
I think that's a concern, but more to the point of impeachment there were 10 instances that Mueller identified what would have qualified as obstruction of justice in the Nixon era. And I think that 900 prosecutors from both sides of the aisle... federal prosecutors said would have been basis for felony prosecution and imprisonment, so I think it's serious. Now, the question before us is what do we do about it? I know we're going to have these hearings and Speaker Pelosi has said we shouldn't jump to impeachment, but, you know, we're not having the hearings to create TV, we're not an academic institution, we're not having the hearings... you know, they talk about something like censure, which is slapping him on the wrist. I mean the Constitution says that Congress should decide if the president has committed treason, bribery, and high crimes and misdemeanors, and this is consistent with what the Nixon impeachment was about. So I think you can call it what you want. It is impeachment. I think that's where we're headed. I think that's Congress' job. I think Justin Amash's analysis in his tweets was pretty right on.
LUIS: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez... she's got a lot of really bold ideas and a big social media presence. She also has a resolution in the House of Representatives, Green New Deal, which is co-sponsored by some 12 U.S. senators and more than 90 members of Congress. Do you support it?
PETERS: I don't for two reasons. One... is policy and one is strategy. In terms of policy... look, you can't complain about a lot of what it does in terms of stating aspirations for climate change and that we need to get to net zero emissions by mid-century, which is true, but it contains stuff that doesn't have to do with climate. Whether everyone should get a free route to college and whether the government should guarantee jobs, we can have those conversations. I don't particularly think those are good policies and I don't sign resolutions that I don't agree with. So, although it's hard to complain about the aspirations of the climate parts, it's got more in there than that. And the second reason is strategic. The effect of that... the going beyond climate has meant that this is entirely a Democratic resolution. And as someone who's very concerned about climate, I think the imperative is that we find bipartisan agreement because we can't get anything passed unless we get Republicans and Democrats working together. So I think that's... in terms of strategy for saving the planet it takes us in the wrong direction. Now, people argue that it generates a lot of enthusiasm, which is great, and I think it does and if it's brought new people to the debate that's great. I've been working on this for 20 years and I think the priority for me is to find bipartisan support, so I don't agree with the need for this. I don't agree with the... I don't disagree with the primacy of the issue and the existential threat to the planet. I just think that I have to work on getting solutions and I think my way is certainly more comfortable for me.
LUIS: What's it like... what's the climate for working together? You know, just reaching across the aisle, what's that like?
PETERS: I think you might get the impression that it's very hostile... from the TV, and it's actually not... So I had this experience with Darrell Issa. Darrell was obviously running for a long time. I came to Darrell and we worked on a bill that everyone could agree with on reforming H-1B visas... high-tech visas were being abused and they were letting in people who really weren't the kind of people we're trying... and so we tried to tighten that up together. And I thought this is great, Darrell and I are buds, man. And then the next day he came out, he had endorsed my opponent. And I thought... it sort of hurt... it hurt my feelings for a minute, I thought we were friends, but you realize that that's the business side of it. And so if you play sports against somebody you try to beat them, but it doesn't mean you can't be friendly. And that's really kind of the best analogy or it's like... I was told that when you're a lawyer try a case so that you could have a beer with your opponent. And I think that's kind... you know, with most people we get along very well and so on some issues we found people that I could be a partner with. So I'm doing a lot of... we're trying to reduce drug prices with Larry Bucshon from Indiana. I'm trying to do some hydropower reforms with Greg Walden of Oregon. And this bill... this Disaster Act... of all people, I'm working with Mark Meadows who's the... like the leader of the Freedom Caucus and was the main person trying to get Paul Ryan out because he was... not conservative enough. And so I used to always joke with Mark. I said you and I are both against Paul Ryan. That was pretty funny, but... you know, the idea is that when we had Superstorm Sandy we spent about $60 billion dollars off budget because of this extreme weather event. I'm concerned about climate change and the budget. He was concerned about the budget. There's no budgeting for this thing. And that was Mark's concern, so we came together and this is in the nature of an adaptation bill. And so I think you can do things together and... I think that's our job.
LUIS: You definitely sound like a moderate. You present yourself as a moderate. Democratic Party... there's this whole perception that the Democratic Party is moving a little bit too much to the left. What are Democrats getting wrong in Congress?
PETERS: Well, if you think that the party's moving left, I challenge that. I think actually that's not in fact the case, so let me take apart a couple things you said. One is whether we're moderates. Well, on civil rights issues... I don't think there's a lot of daylight among Democrats. Whether it's the transgender ban or marriage equality, whether it's women's right to choose, whether it's how you treat Dreamers and immigrants, voting rights for African Americans we're all as left-wing or whatever that is... pro-civil rights as anybody.
ABBY: There was a lot of speculation that you would run for mayor... why didn't you?
PETERS: I thought about it really hard and I just assumed I would. I had people suggesting that I do it. I thought I was going to have support. I felt... our polling was very strong and then I saw what it was like to... oh, actually, we got to the point where we had lined up a campaign manager and a communications person and actually had drafted the script for the video that we were going to do... the announcement video, but I started to look around in Congress and I realized this majority thing is a lot different. Now I'm not just... I'm in a position actually to influence what's happening. The era of Trump is really of concern to me and I think... you know, I'm not scared to take it on. I've reached a point in my career where I'm confident that I kind of can make an effect, and so I just decided this was too much to walk away from. And even if I had... I would have been in Congress for... during this time, but running a mayor's race from 3,000 miles away would have really required 120 percent of my time. And so... it would have really prevented me from working on these things, so I just decided it was too much to walk away from and it's important. And so I go into a room of supporters and they still split about half and half, you know, I wish you'd run for mayor, but I'm so glad... or I'm so glad you stayed, but I think it was the right thing to do right now.
LUIS: Social media and politics have intersected greatly since the Obama years. First I want to know like what's your favorite platform? Like what...
PETERS: So I like Instagram because I like... you know, this is ridiculous... I mean for me to say I could be a little bit creative, but I like putting interesting things up that I think are funny. It's fun to share... if something interesting happens it's kind of fun to show people what's going on and...
LUIS: Yeah, like a House sit-in.
PETERS: Yeah. Something like that, yeah.
ABBY: The original live streamer.
PETERS: Yeah. That's me, right?
ABBY: Where you're Periscoping from the floor.
PETERS: So we had a... you're talking about the protest.
ABBY: Yeah, the sit-in.
PETERS: After the Orlando shooting... I was going to a meeting at Steny Hoyer's office and it got canceled. And I'm sort of annoyed because I walked all the way over there, it was canceled, no one told me, so I called and I said what's going on? They said John Lewis is leading a sit-in on the House floor. I said that's kind of historic, so I said okay, I'll go. And there's John Lewis sitting down on the House floor, which is totally against the rules, you're not supposed to do that, with some other people and the people are giving these speeches. And... and I said well, this is kind of cool, but I called my office and I said the cameras aren't on. No one knows that they're doing this. I'm coming back. And Quinn, who since actually has moved from Washington to San Diego because she knows this is better...
LUIS: This is one of your aides?
PETERS: One of my staffers, yeah. She's my digital media person. She says why don't you download Periscope and broadcast it? And so I... okay, so I had to go to the app store. There's Periscope.
LUIS: Did you even know what Periscope was?
PETERS: No, no. And it says Twitter or Facebook. I picked Twitter. I didn't know. And then I... and then it says broadcast, so I started doing it. And I did it for a little while. You're not supposed to take pictures on the House floor let alone videos and they're pretty strict about it. I did it for a little while and then it happened that I was scheduled to call my daughter at 1 o'clock to talk about one of her job opportunities. I was doing some job counseling, so I did go off the floor for that and went to make a phone call. And after I called... I had talked to her I looked back at this thing and people were saying like why'd you turn it off? That was really interesting... So it go two million views that day.
ABBY: Any fights left that are most important to you that you want to do more on, that you want to get in there and make a difference?
PETERS: I want to save the planet from climate change. That's actually explicitly what I want to do. Part of that is fighting and... fighting off the Trump administration's rollback on car standards, methane capture, but part of it is building and I really want to devote myself to that. I'm as concerned (as) anyone about the existential threat that climate change presents. I want to work on that. I want to do that both locally with respect to transportation and housing, but I also want to do it at a national level and worldwide. So there's plenty of work for me.

Tech startups face obstacles in H-1B hiring
Work visa policies favor large companies, says study by
 UCSD and Cornell researchers

American visa policies are discouraging foreign tech workers from working in startups, according to a study from Cornell University and UC San Diego researchers.
The study examined hiring of foreign workers educated in science and engineering at American universities. These workers apply to and get offers from startups at the same rate as U.S. citizens. But they are only half as likely to be hired.
The disparity is important because access to foreign talent gives companies a competitive edge that startups are missing out on, the study said.
"We often see great innovations coming from Google and Apple, but a lot of their innovation is actually from buying startups," John Skrentny, one of the study's authors, said in a statement. "These startups have trouble accessing the foreign talent our best universities are graduating."
The report was published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Its authors are Michael Roach of Cornell and Skrentny, director of UC San Diego's Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research.
The employment discrepancy is not explained by foreign workers' preferences for secure jobs or higher pay, the study said. Rather, larger, more established companies have an advantage over startups in sponsoring foreign employees for H-1B or permanent residency visas.
"Startups typically have limited resources and managerial attention, and recruiting talented workers is a major activity for founders," the study said. "This may be particularly challenging for technology startups seeking to hire highly specialized Ph.D.s, as the number of potential employees with the necessary expertise may be small and difficult to find."
Moreover, sponsoring a visa can cost from $5,000 to $10,000 and take several months, a challenge for small startups. But larger companies such as Google and Qualcomm can leverage their existing human resources department expertise - they don't have to start from scratch.
Karine Wenger, an immigration attorney who works with both startups and Fortune 500 corporations, said fledgling companies often find the whole process daunting.
"Startups may not even have an HR program, let alone a robust in-house immigration program," said Wenger, who works in the San Diego office of immigration law firm Fragomen.
In recent years, H-1Bs are under "increased scrutiny" under the Trump administration, Wenger said. The federal government is requiring companies to supply more information - and do more paperwork - than in the past.
The new study is based on a nine-year survey of 2,324 Ph.D.s in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, beginning in graduate school. They studied at 39 top American research universities.
Many of the H-1B visas go to IT (information technology) businesses, said Kevin Carroll, executive director of Tech San Diego, a local technology trade group. Large companies such as India's Tata Consultancy Services scoop up the visas for their projects.
"But there has been a movement in the past couple of years to make sure that smaller and midsize companies are also having access to these H-1B visas," Carroll said.
Even if access is expanded, Carroll said these visas will remain out of reach for many startups because of the time and expense of getting them.
Carroll said startups can find workarounds, such as getting summer interns from UC San Diego or similar universities with large numbers of foreign tech students. At UCSD, the Rady School of Management provides a point of contact, he said.

denial rates up for Guest worker visas
Number of applications rejected quadrupled from fiscal 2015 to 2018

Denial rates for high-skilled worker visas have quadrupled since 2015, a trend that makes it much harder for companies that rely on these workers to find and retain talent.
According to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, denial rates for first-time H-1B visa applicants increased from 6 percent to 24 percent between fiscal years 2015 and 2018. And the trend is growing.
Through the first half of fiscal year 2019, USCIS denied 33 percent of initial H-1B visa applications, data shows. 
H-1B visas are highly sought-after work visas for high-skilled workers like computer engineers and programmers. Each April, USCIS receives about 200,000 applications for only 85,000 visas. There are two types of H-1B visas - initial applications for new employees and continuing applications for renewals or employees who change jobs.
The denials increased during the last year of the Obama administration but accelerated under President Donald Trump as he introduced policies to protect American workers by preventing fraud. These new policies placed greater scrutiny on applications and raised the standards for awarding and renewing foreign worker visas, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan nonprofit that recently analyzed USCIS' own data.
"We had been hearing that companies had experienced more denials, but (it isn't) until you put the numbers together, (that) it became clear how large a change in policy there had been and how big of an impact it's having," said Stuart Anderson, the executive director for the National Foundation for American Policy.
Anderson said the denials hurt companies in two ways. First, it limits growth because companies cannot hire new employees. Second it jeopardizes quality control because experienced employees who are denied their visa renewal have to stop working.
"And, on a personal level, it can really have a negative impact on an organization to lose people who have been working there for many years," he added.
Some of the country's most profitable and well-known companies have had more H-1B visa applications denied.
Microsoft, IBM, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, Walmart, Google, Amazon and Facebook all had their worker visa denial rates increase between 2015 and the first half of 2019, according to data from USCIS.
The two accounting firms saw their denial rates increase by 40 percent between that time. IBM experienced a 30 percent increase, JPMorgan Chase 13 percent, and both Walmart and Microsoft saw a 12 percent increase in denial rates. Google, Facebook and Apple also experienced an increase, albeit less dramatic. Their denial rates went from 1 percent in 2015 to about 5 percent in 2019, data shows.
Ron Hira, a professor at Howard University who has been looking at the H-1B visa program for years says this is the first time since the program began 30 years ago that the government is actually enforcing standards.
Hira pointed to a 2015 scandal in which Southern California Edison's American IT workers were laid off and asked to train H-1B visa employees who took their jobs as an example of how the program is in need of reform.
"The H-1B program is rife with abuse and exploitation, but prior administrations - both GOP and Democratic - essentially rubber-stamped petitions," he said. "I'm sure employers don't like the increased scrutiny but that doesn't mean the government is doing anything wrong."
Here in San Diego, Qualcomm had 17 guest worker visas denied in 2019. That is more visas than the company was denied between 2009 and 2017, data show. Qualcomm is among the biggest employers of H-1B workers in California. The company routinely employs hundreds of foreign workers a year. Therefore the denial rates, while increasing, are much lower than the national average.
The company did not respond to a request for comment. Qualcomm has historically supported increasing the cap limit on worker visas, which was established in the 1990s.
Smaller tech companies in San Diego experienced significantly higher denial rates. IT consulting firm Vastek had 29 applications denied in 2019 and zero approved. 
Other local companies such as Sydata, Ellianse and Sysintelli had denial rates above 50 percent. None of those companies responded to a request for comment.
San Diego-based immigration lawyer Jacob Sapochnick has seen the trend first-hand for the last two years.
"We've definitely seen more denials for small companies," Sapochnick said. "Not just San Diego but across the states."
Specifically, IT consulting firms seem to be receiving greater scrutiny in their applications, Sapochnick added.
USCIS will question whether the company has enough work to justify the hiring or if the jobs being offered are complex enough to qualify as specialty occupations. Sapochnick has also heard from clients who receive on-site visits from USCIS agents asking questions about who is working there, what their job title is and how much money they earn.
In February 2018, USCIS published a policy memo outlining tougher standards specifically for companies that hire for "third-party workplaces" such as IT consulting companies.
"Based on the agency's experience administering the H-1B program, USCIS recognizes that significant employer violations - such as paying less than the required wage, benching employees (not paying workers the required wage while they wait for projects or work) and having employees perform nonspecialty jobs - may be more likely to occur when petitioners place employees at third-party worksites," the memo states.
Sapochnick says each denial has real-world consequences.
One client was recently denied a continuing H-1B application. He had been with the same company in San Diego for eight years but had to go back to Bangladesh after his renewal was denied.
Fortunately, his employer helped him apply for a green card so he could be back after a year, Sapochnick added.
