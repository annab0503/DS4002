SAN FRANCISCO -- Rajiv Dabhadkar was three blocks from his New Jersey home on Oct. 2 when police motioned his car to the side of the road.
Dabhadkar, a computer programmer from India here on an H-1B visa, was handcuffed and held in jail for several hours. When released, he was fined $ 250 for an unpaid parking ticket.
Though authorities gave him no reason for the seemingly harsh treatment, Dabhadkar speculates he was hassled because of his ethnicity. "I'm completely shaken," says Dabhadkar, 32.
It's a tense time for Dabhadkar and other Asian and Middle Eastern workers in the United States on H-1B visas.
They came in large numbers in recent years to fill high-tech jobs. Many came from India, and they are predominately Hindus. But tensions -- already heightened in the workplace with massive tech industry layoffs -- have risen since Sept. 11.
Threatening notes, demanding that Indian workers "go home" have been left anonymously in workers' cubicles at numerous companies, human resource specialists say. Three Fortune 100 companies this month started offering advice and support to jittery H-1B workers. And some companies, including software makers Electronic Arts and Intuit, are warning foreign workers to carry visa documents in case they get stopped at even domestic airport checks.
"People start wondering, 'Should I move to Canada?' " says Satjiv Chahil, chief marketing officer of the Silicon Valley-based handheld-maker Palm. Chahil is an Indian Sikh. They often wear turbans now associated by many with terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.
"It's a double whammy: There's tension at work and hostility in everyday life," says Lucy Lee, an immigration lawyer with Fallon Bixby Cheng & Lee in San Francisco.
Since Sept. 11, people who look even somewhat Arabic, regardless of their religion or native country, have been threatened and assaulted.
The Sikh owner of a gas station in Mesa, Ariz., was shot to death last month. A Palm employee, Jatinder Narang, 28, a turban-wearing, bearded Indian Sikh, was run off the road while driving to work. Supreet Manchanda, 37, another Indian Sikh who works as a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, was assaulted with verbal epithets by a white man at a neighborhood gas station. More than 235 Sikhs have reported incidents to anti-defamation group Sikh Mediawatch and Resource Task Force in Washington, D.C.
Before Sept. 11, the Asian American Public Policy Institute in Silicon Valley had received more complaints this year than in the past 5 years about divisions between H-1B workers and American co-workers, says director Kim Singh, who is Indian. Since the attacks, he's gotten five times as many calls and e-mails, about 200 so far, from foreign workers, mostly on H-1B visas, who have been "laid off, abused or made to feel uncomfortable at work."
Economic, now social backlash
No one doubts that the terrorist attacks have battered an already reeling economy. And they've complicated an already dicey situation over H-1B workers.
Under the visa program, created by the Immigration Act of 1990, American firms can hire foreign workers with hard-to-find technical skills. Workers get up to a 6-year visa and can apply for permanent residency. Nationwide, there are about 425,000 to 500,000 H-1B holders. Many are in Silicon Valley and in computer programming and electrical engineering. The biggest group is from India, at 44%, says the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Even before Sept. 11, the H-1B program had detractors. According to a recent survey of more than 1,000 technology workers by the Web site techies.com, 85% say the H-1B program lowers wages and endangers job security.
"Non-residents say they are targets of prejudice.  . . .  Permanent residents say their jobs are in jeopardy and their pay suffers. No one wins," says Cynthia Morgan, executive producer of techies.com.
Though federal law requires firms to pay H-1B workers as much as Americans for comparable work, many firms get around that, immigration lawyers say.
Enforcement is slack. And many firms hire through "body shops," which subcontract the H-1B workers to other firms.
H-1B workers make up to 33% less than their American counterparts, according to a recent study by the University of California at Los Angeles. A similar Cornell University study found a 20% to 30% pay disparity.
That makes American workers angry.
Unemployed for 7 months earlier this year, computer programmer Pat MacCormick found herself near bankruptcy. But the single mom, 46, wasn't angry at her former employer, the Fingerhut catalog company in Minnetonka, Minn., or the economy. It centered on H-1B workers. She says her skills aren't needed because companies can hire cheaper tech workers from overseas.
"It's brutal when an abundance of H-1B (workers) are being offered to companies," MacCormick says.
Companies say Americans aren't losing jobs to lower-paid H-1B workers. If they cut jobs, they do so based on needs, they say. More than 470,000 tech and telecom jobs in the USA have been lost this year, says outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas.
"The concept of Americans being laid off because of higher wages is bogus," says Murali Krishna Devarakonda, a board member of the Immigrants Support Network. "Most employers make cuts based on unneeded projects and lower performers."
Tracking layoffs of H-1B visa workers as a percentage of layoffs is almost impossible, says Lindsay Lowell of the Georgetown University Institute for the Study of International Migration. The government doesn't track them. And, H-1Bs get counted as new if workers switch jobs. That makes numbers suspect.
Tensions high; now higher
Still, interviews with dozens of American and foreign workers nationwide revealed that tensions were rising between them before the attacks as layoffs mounted -- and that both groups continue to suffer.
Before his arrest, Dabhadkar worked for 2 years on short-term projects for several firms, including Merrill Lynch and AT&T. He says office relations became more strained as economic woes mounted. Co-workers started leaving him "out of the loop" on decisions.
"They treated me as though I was non-existent because I wasn't American," he says.
When the economy was soaring, foreign and American tech workers socialized and shared ideas, says Rama Prasad, 43, an Indian H-1B software worker in New York. But with layoffs rising, paranoia and distrust set in, not only between Americans and foreigners but between different foreign workers, too. Korean and Philippine co-workers started making derogatory jokes about his meat-free diet, he says. The party invitations dried up, and ethnic groups now go their separate ways for lunch and breaks.
"The mood at work turned from cordial to antagonistic," Prasad says. Because of Sept. 11 and the ensuing assaults on Indians, his mother, who still lives in India, has urged him to move to India because she fears for his safety.
American workers, too, have felt the frost. "There was a definite split," says Linda Nesheim, 49, a computer-programming contractor who was let go last month from Fingerhut. Since early last year, the number of American computer contractors at Fingerhut has fallen 20%, to 80, the company says. The number of H-1B visa contractors has stayed at 68.
Fingerhut rejects the notion that it is letting American workers go because H-1B visa workers are less expensive. "No one was targeted," Fingerhut spokesman Ben Saukko says.
Marc Topoleski, a Detroit-based immigration lawyer, says racial tensions at work often increase during tough economic times. He expects the terrorist attacks to create more job losses and more tension between American and foreign workers. "They compound and underscore an already tense work environment," he says. "It's similar to the backlash against imported Japanese cars in the 1970s and (the North American Free Trade Agreement) in the 1980s."
While companies such as Sun Microsystems, Oracle and Microsoft refused comment, human resource consultants to tech firms say more firms are taking steps to defuse problems since Sept. 11. Several firms recently hired ComPsych, a counseling service, to support H-1B visa workers who've received glares and hostile notes, says ComPsych CEO Richard Chaifetz. He won't name his clients.
Before the attacks, Dianne Blomberg, a Denver-based consultant, had received calls from several companies worried that layoffs were hurting relations between American and foreign-born workers. Since Sept. 11, more companies, including a major software and health care firm, are developing cultural awareness and tolerance workshops, she says. "There's a sense of more urgency.  . . .  Companies are worried about a carryover of violence from Sept. 11."
Productivity suffers when workers are at odds -- a situation that is particularly costly when companies must do more with fewer workers in a sluggish economy.
Changing times
So far, no changes to the H-1B visa program have been proposed, even though lawmakers have started weighing tighter visa requirements for students and non-tech job seekers.
Pre-attack, U.S. Rep. Jim Ramstad (R-Minn.) had already expressed concern to other lawmakers that American workers were being replaced by H-1B holders. He suggested lowering the number of H-1B visa workers allowed in the USA. Just last year, the tech industry, pointing to almost 1 million unfilled U.S. tech jobs, persuaded Congress to increase the number of H-1B visas granted annually by 70% to 195,000.
Now, the drumbeat may go the other way, observers say. "Given the economic climate, it makes sense to lower the H-1B cap ceiling," Ramstad says.
What's more, all foreign workers are likely to see tighter security than American co-workers experience. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has introduced legislation that would give immigration officials electronic access to FBI crime data, allowing them to check visa applications more closely.
Since Sept. 11, Comforce, a New York-based high-tech consulting firm that has 18 H-1B visa workers, is running criminal background checks on candidates for computer-security jobs. "In this climate, you can't be too careful," says Phil Preston, senior president.
The heightened security and anxiety have taken an emotional toll on workers like Dabhadkar, who has lived in the USA for 10 years, has a family and is looking for work.
"What should I do?" he asks. "I'm at my wits' end."

Who can expect $1,400 checks?; Not everyone who got cash last time will again

President Joe Biden said many Americans should receive their $1,400 payments before the end of the month if his COVID-19 relief package passes.
WASHINGTON - A third round of coronavirus aid checks should be coming soon, probably within days or weeks.
Millions of Americans reeling from the economic damage of the pandemic would get one-time direct payments of up to $1,400. The payments are part of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, his first major initiative since taking office in January, which is likely to get final approval in the House on Wednesday morning.
Not everyone will get the checks.
Just like the two previous rounds of payments - $1,200 per person distributed last spring and $600 per person in December - some people will be left out.
Here's a closer look at who will get the checks, and who won't.
High-wage earners
Congress made a major change that will limit who will get the checks this time.
Under the new legislation, individuals with an adjusted gross income of $80,000 or less ($160,000 for joint filers) are eligible for a one-time payment of up to $1,400, plus an additional $1,400 for each dependent child. The payments start to phase out for individuals earning $75,000 and will cut off completely for anyone who makes more than $80,000. For couples filing jointly, the phaseout starts for those making $150,000 and cuts off at $160,000.
The Internal Revenue Service will probably use tax returns on file to calculate how much money people will get. If recipients have already filed a return for 2020, their check will be based on their income from last year. If not, their 2019 returns will probably be used to determine how much they'll get.
The new eligibility rules mean the checks will phase out more quickly than during the two previous rounds, when the cutoff was $99,000 for individuals and $198,000 for joint filers with no children.
Congress changed the eligibility requirements in response to concerns by Republicans and some moderate Democrats who argued the payments should go to the people who need them most.
The faster phaseout will mean as many as 6.5 million Americans who got checks in the first two rounds will be left out, said Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank.
Students
Another revision this time is good news for many students.
In the first two rounds of pandemic relief, students ages 17 or older didn't qualify for a check if their parents or guardians claimed them as a dependent. Nor did their parents receive the extra money awarded for each dependent child. That applied only to children ages 16 and younger.
The result was that many high school juniors and seniors and college students didn't get a check, and their parents didn't get the additional money.
This time, parents with dependent children of any age will receive $1,400 per dependent as long as they meet the income eligibility requirements.
Elderly and disabled people
Most senior citizens will qualify for a check, just as they did during the first two rounds. One change will mean that some seniors who were excluded last year will be eligible this time.
Under the first two rounds of payments, seniors and disabled adults were eligible for a check as long as no one else claimed them as a dependent. If so, they didn't qualify. For example, if a disabled adult lived at home with his or her parents and the parents claimed him or her as a dependent on their income taxes, the disabled adult didn't get a check.
This time, seniors and disabled adults who are claimed as dependents by someone else will be eligible for a check.
Advocacy groups for the elderly pushed for Congress to make senior dependents eligible for the payments, arguing that it would provide much-needed relief to families who often face both a heavy emotional and financial cost attending to the needs of an older adult.
Expanding the definition of eligible dependents will mean that as many as 26 million more people could qualify for a check, said Kyle Pomerleau, a tax policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.
Immigrants
Just like in the first two rounds, immigrants qualify for a check if they meet the eligibility criteria and have a valid Social Security number.
Immigrants with green cards or H-1B and H-2A work visas are eligible for a check. Nonresidents, temporary workers and immigrants in the country illegally are not.
Mixed-status families - those with different citizenship and immigration classifications - will be eligible for a check as long as one member of the household has a Social Security number. In other words, if one spouse is a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident and the other spouse isn't, the family will still qualify for a check as long as one of them has a Social Security number.
Such families were ineligible for a check during the first round of payments, which meant as many as 5.1 million U.S. citizens and documented immigrants were excluded, according to the Migration Policy Institute.
Congress allowed mixed-status families to receive a check during the second round late last year and made the policy retroactive so families could claim payments missed during the first round.
People who don't file taxes
Low-income people who haven't filed taxes in the past two years are eligible for a check, but millions of them won't get one unless they take an extra step.
Social Security recipients will automatically get a relief check if the IRS follows the same procedure as the first two rounds. If so, the government will use Social Security data to determine how much they receive and where it will be sent.
For others who haven't filed taxes in the past two years, it's a different story.
Individuals aren't required to file taxes if they make less than $12,000 a year. The tax preparation company TurboTax estimates that 10 million Americans fall into that category, and they include some low-income individuals, Supplemental Security Income recipients and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries.
Those individuals are eligible for a relief check, but without their income tax returns, it's harder for the IRS to verify their income, calculate their payout and know where to send it.
Last year, the IRS set up a web portal that will allow them to register for a payment. The federal government hasn't indicated how it will identify them this time or calculate their payments. Garrett said the IRS is expected to rely on the online portal for the third round as well.
How soon will the checks arrive?
Hard to say. The Treasury Department hasn't indicated when it will start distributing the money.
Garrett said the timeline will probably be similar to the second round of payments approved in December. Americans who got their checks via direct deposit started to receive the payments about two weeks after the legislation was signed into law. Those who got a paper check had to wait longer.
Biden said last week that many Americans should receive their payments before the end of the month.
The IRS said in mid-February it had distributed all checks to everyone who was eligible in the first two rounds.
More than 160 million payments totaling $270 billion were distributed during the first round last spring, the agency said. More than 147 million payments totaling more than $142 billion were delivered during the second round late last year.
President Joe Biden said many Americans should receive their $1,400 payments before the end of the month if his COVID-19 relief package passes.

Tech firms' hiring practices ignore idle Americans

Today's debate: Tech worker visas
Our view: Visa push is unjustifiable in view of highly skilled U.S. workers.
A funny thing is happening on the way to the unemployment lines this recession: Even as thousands upon thousands of domestic tech workers are getting pink slips, technology companies are working overtime to bring programmers and computer engineers in from abroad.
In the past 10 months, the dot-com industry alone has seen almost 100,000 layoffs. At the same time, tech companies got government approval to sponsor a near record number of foreign-born workers under a special visa program called H-1B.
Industry has long claimed it needed these special visas because U.S. schools weren't churning out enough highly skilled engineers and computer programmers. But their pursuit of foreign workers when so many highly qualified Americans are unemployed gives the lie to that excuse. It looks more like the tech industry is just trying to keep its labor costs down by importing cheaper labor.
Even in the midst of the 1990s boom, the industry's tales of desperate worker shortages were never very believable. Independent studies could not confirm them. Wage increases for computer programmers, who make up the bulk of special visa applicants, climbed a modest 7%, not what you'd expect if the industry were really trying to attract employees to the field. And tech companies were being extraordinarily picky, hiring in some cases just 2% of applicants.
Nevertheless, the tech industry was one of the heaviest users of a special visa program that Congress set up in 1990 as a way for companies to meet specialized workforce needs. It accounted for nearly 60% of all such visas in 1999.
The tech industry also aggressively pushed Congress to expand the number of visas issued. Just to make sure Congress heard those pleadings, the computer industry poured money into campaign coffers, giving more than $ 39 million in the last election cycle alone. Result: Since the H-1B program started in 1990, Congress has tripled the number of visas allowed each year, setting the current cap at 195,000. This past year, more than 160,000 immigrants came in under the program.
That helped the industry keep wage costs down. Data from the Immigration and Naturalization Service show, in fact, that these immigrant workers were making about $ 50,000 a year, well below the average pay for their jobs. A National Research Council report last year found that the large number of these workers helped keep wages "from rising as fast as might be expected."
Incredibly, in the midst of the current slump, with thousands of engineers and programmers sitting idle, the tech industry continues to trot out the same claims about a lack of skilled workers to justify the surge in visa applications.
True, the U.S. could turn out more computer programmers and top engineers. Also true, however, is that there is plenty of good homegrown talent sitting idle.
There's nothing illegal about an industry trying to hold down costs. Pressure from consumers who want inexpensive products, and investors who want high profits, demands nothing less. But the tech industry could be honest about what it's doing by importing so many workers. Better, it could look for economies elsewhere.

Two Big Biz are ripe targets for GOP; Tech, Hollywood not very popular

The Republicans have a real opportunity to connect with voters and win big in 2016. To do so, they'll have to get over their traditional love for Big Business, but the prospects don't look bright.
Many businesses aligned with Democrats are unpopular with the public, and wide open for attack. One very appealing target would be the tech industry's wage-suppressing hiring habits. Not only have tech giants such as Apple and Google engaged in what a federal court called an "overarching conspiracy" to prevent wage competition, but Silicon Valley firms also abuse H-1B visas to bring in immigrant competition at lower wages.
How can the GOP take advantage? First, impose a much stricter prevailing wage law for H-1B visas, with big damages against violators. You can import foreign help, but you have to pay those Indian or Chinese software engineers the prevailing wage for American software engineers, rather than paying the pittance most companies pay now.
Tech companies claim they can't find enough qualified Americans, but that excuse is bogus. Companies also draw out the H-1B application process to keep workers away from competitors. Maybe shortening the application process there would be a good idea, too, or creating damages that trial lawyers can exploit.
Tech companies will hate this. It might even split the Silicon Valley worker bees from the oligarchs. For added fun, have some hearings where fat-cat Silicon Valley oligarchs are grilled about worker exploitation.
Another big Democratic industry is entertainment, and here too there are lots of opportunities. The industry has been abusing intellectual property laws for years. The recording industry is notorious for ripping off artists.
America could use more legislation and oversight to remedy these abuses, which have been permitted mostly because Hollywood and Silicon Valley have been big Democratic donors. The GOP-dominated Congress can pass bills to protect U.S. workers and consumers from the depredations of these industries between now and 2016.
But I'm not too optimistic. That's because the GOP seems unwilling to criticize Big Business. Some see this unwillingness as a support for free markets, but big businesses tend to support heavy regulation, taxes, antitrust violations and other things that reduce competition. They have enough political clout to get favorable government treatment. Small businesses and middle-class Americans do not.
If you really support free markets -- in which competition is based on price and quality, not government preference -- then you're going to find yourself opposing Big Business fairly often. If you never find yourself opposing Big Business, then maybe you don't really support free markets.
That's something for Republican politicians -- and for voters -- to keep in mind.

The payments start to phase out for individuals earning $75,000 and will cut off completely for anyone who makes more than $80,000. For couples filing jointly, the phaseout starts for those making $150,000 and cuts off at $160,000.
The Internal Revenue Service will probably use tax returns on file to calculate how much money people will get. If recipients have already filed a return for 2020, their check will be based on their income from last year. If not, their 2019 returns will probably be used to determine how much they'll get.
The new eligibility rules mean the checks will phase out more quickly than during the two previous rounds, when the cutoff was $99,000 for individuals and $198,000 for joint filers with no children.
Congress changed the eligibility requirements in response to concerns by Republicans and some moderate Democrats who argued the payments should go to the people who need them most.
The faster phaseout will mean as many as 6.5 million Americans who got checks in the first two rounds will be left out, said Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank.
Students
Another revision this time is good news for many students.
In the first two rounds of pandemic relief, students ages 17 or older didn't qualify for a check if their parents or guardians claimed them as a dependent. Nor did their parents receive the extra money awarded for each dependent child. That applied only to children ages 16 and younger.
The result was that many high school juniors and seniors and college students didn't get a check, and their parents didn't get the additional money.
This time, parents with dependent children of any age will receive $1,400 per dependent as long as they meet the income eligibility requirements.
Elderly and disabled people
Most senior citizens will qualify for a check, just as they did during the first two rounds. One change will mean that some seniors who were excluded last year will be eligible this time.
Under the first two rounds of payments, seniors and disabled adults were eligible for a check as long as no one else claimed them as a dependent. If so, they didn't qualify. For example, if a disabled adult lived at home with his or her parents and the parents claimed him or her as a dependent on their income taxes, the disabled adult didn't get a check.
This time, seniors and disabled adults who are claimed as dependents by someone else will be eligible for a check.
Advocacy groups for the elderly pushed for Congress to make senior dependents eligible for the payments, arguing that it would provide much-needed relief to families who often face both a heavy emotional and financial cost attending to the needs of an older adult.
Expanding the definition of eligible dependents will mean that as many as 26 million more people could qualify for a check, said Kyle Pomerleau, a tax policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute.
Immigrants
Just like in the first two rounds, immigrants qualify for a check if they meet the eligibility criteria and have a valid Social Security number.
Immigrants with green cards or H-1B and H-2A work visas are eligible for a check. Nonresidents, temporary workers and immigrants in the country illegally are not.
Mixed-status families - those with different citizenship and immigration classifications - will be eligible for a check as long as one member of the household has a Social Security number. In other words, if one spouse is a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident and the other spouse isn't, the family will still qualify for a check as long as one of them has a Social Security number.
Such families were ineligible for a check during the first round of payments, which meant as many as 5.1 million U.S. citizens and documented immigrants were excluded, according to the Migration Policy Institute.
Congress allowed mixed-status families to receive a check during the second round late last year and made the policy retroactive so families could claim payments missed during the first round.
People who don't file taxes
Low-income people who haven't filed taxes in the past two years are eligible for a check, but millions of them won't get one unless they take an extra step.
Social Security recipients will automatically get a relief check if the IRS follows the same procedure as the first two rounds. If so, the government will use Social Security data to determine how much they receive and where it will be sent.
For others who haven't filed taxes in the past two years, it's a different story.
Individuals aren't required to file taxes if they make less than $12,000 a year. The tax preparation company TurboTax estimates that 10 million Americans fall into that category, and they include some low-income individuals, Supplemental Security Income recipients and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries.
Those individuals are eligible for a relief check, but without their income tax returns, it's harder for the IRS to verify their income, calculate their payout and know where to send it.
Last year, the IRS set up a web portal that will allow them to register for a payment. The federal government hasn't indicated how it will identify them this time or calculate their payments. Garrett said the IRS is expected to rely on the online portal for the third round as well.
How soon will the checks arrive?
Hard to say. The Treasury Department hasn't indicated when it will start distributing the money.
Garrett said the timeline will probably be similar to the second round of payments approved in December. Americans who got their checks via direct deposit started to receive the payments about two weeks after the legislation was signed into law. Those who got a paper check had to wait longer.
Biden said last week that many Americans should receive their payments before the end of the month.
The IRS said in mid-February it had distributed all checks to everyone who was eligible in the first two rounds.
More than 160 million payments totaling $270 billion were distributed during the first round last spring, the agency said. More than 147 million payments totaling more than $142 billion were delivered during the second round late last year.
President Joe Biden said many Americans should receive their $1,400 payments before the end of the month if his COVID-19 relief package passes.

Today's debate: Tech worker visas
Opposing view: Tech firms must find the right mix to compete in a global market.
Doing what's right does not always mean doing what's popular.
The information technology industry, which has created hundreds of thousands of new, high paying jobs in the last several years, is currently in a slump. Many companies have been forced to lay off high-tech employees. So some think now is the time to cut back on America's use of highly skilled foreign workers. Right? Wrong.
America needs workers with the best available technical skills--regardless of their national origin. The U.S. competes in a global economy. Many companies generate 50% or more of their sales in overseas markets -- markets growing at rates much faster than here at home. Competitiveness depends not on artificial trade barriers but on the implicit quality and value of products and services offered.
And that means finding the right people with the right combination of skills, experience and, in many cases, knowledge of local markets. No single country has a monopoly on high-tech skills, not even the USA. The good news is that one country, this country, is the beacon for global tech talent.
This is not to say that the industry can underpay foreign professionals or turn its back on American workers. Current law requires employers to pay individuals entering the country on H-1B visas the prevailing wage offered to similarly situated U.S. workers. Visa processing, legal and other fees increase the cost of going this route. Perhaps the additional expense of H-1B workers explains why the number of visas granted this year has fallen short of the legal limit.
Meanwhile, employers participating in the H-1B program have paid almost $ 100 million into a federal fund for the retraining of Americans in high-tech occupations. But training for many jobs is a slow process in a marketplace that can turn on a dime. Maintaining the H-1B program even in a downturn gives employers the flexible access to existing talent -- and the ability to meet today's market expectations.
So popular or not, here's the bottom line: A talent-driven competitive edge -- not 19th century style immigration dogma -- will dig companies out of this recession. And that is in the best interest of American companies, investors and workers.
Harris N. Miller is president of the Information Technology Association of America, which represents 500 leading companies in the information technology industry.

Jobs news not as good as it sounds; Economy may be adding jobs, but they're dead-enders

The markets are gearing up for the all-important jobs report due out Friday. The report will likely show that last month the economy, once again, added hundreds of thousands of jobs. It's also expected to reveal the rate of U.S. unemployment to be in the seemingly impressive 5% range. Good news? Not so fast.
The headline unemployment rate doesn't take into consideration the millions of people working part time who really want to work full time, nor does it reflect the millions of Americans who have simply given up looking for jobs. Most important, the unemployment rate doesn't tell us anything about the utter lack of wage growth.
Let's face it, 5.5% unemployment, just ain't what it used to be.
At any other point in our economic history, 5.5% unemployment would have felt like a godsend. Americans would tell you they felt extraordinarily prosperous and there was certainty in their economic futures.
Today, middle-class Americans hardly feel prosperous. And, it's no wonder. The U.S. economy is barely registering growth (less than 3% again last quarter), while the latest read on corporate profits shows a recent decline. Meanwhile, adjusted for inflation, Americans' wages are basically stuck where they were nearly two decades ago.
So, does it really matter that we're adding hundreds of thousands of jobs when those jobs aren't paying enough to sustain a middle-class family?
While the most optimistic might argue that any kind of job growth is a step in the right direction and eventually, as the economy strengthens, those low-paying jobs should become better paying, I'd remind them: It's been six years.
Typically, in a post-recession environment, the economy should fare far better than this. Historically, 4% to 5% gross domestic product growth is a reasonable expectation, along with wage growth near 3.8%. Yet, we're nowhere near that.
That's because something else is going on. Something the Fed cannot fix with its record low interest rates and various rounds of quantitative easing.
The harsh reality is our economy is stuck in the middle of a structural shift. Just as when the U.S. struggled with the painful transition from an agrarian-led economy to a manufacturing-led economy, we are currently feeling the effects of a move from a manufacturing economy into a service economy. And, no one is entirely yet sure just how profitable a service economy will be.
Financial services, technology services, consulting and problem solving services -- these may prove to be the most robust industries in the near future, but how does a society transition its workers and provide the right kinds of education for the future economy?
Intelligent policy would help. Education policy that spurs students to focus on STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math -- is critical. While we're at it, we must increase the number of H1B visas so that we can keep more of the world's most talented engineers and mathematicians (already being educated here at American universities) rather than sending them home. Talented individuals enable U.S. companies to grow. They start companies, and they create jobs for others. A more sensible tax policy would also go a long way toward easing our economic transition. Corporate tax reform is needed so that American companies are on even footing with foreign competitors, while a reduction in individual tax rates would put more money in consumers' hands, helping to ease this economic transition.
We can't keep relying on the Fed. The Fed is trying to fight a new problem -- a structural shift in our labor market -- with monetary tools, and it's not working. It's time for Washington to address the unemployment problem head on and stop  complimenting itself for adding so many low-paying, dead-end jobs.

Here's who would not get the $600 stimulus check
USA TODAY

Congress has passed a COVID-19 relief bill  that will provide a second round of stimulus checks to millions of Americans as soon as next week - assuming President Donald Trump doesn't veto it.
But not everyone is eligible for those direct payments. Many students, for instance, don't qualify. Neither do immigrants who don't have a Social Security number. Some elderly and disabled people won't get a check either, along with high-wage earners.
The payments, which aim to give Americans a quick cash infusion, will be distributed if  Trump signs the bill into federal law. That routine signing was upended late Tuesday when the president criticized the bill and urged Congress to increase the stimulus checks to $2,000 from $600, although he stopped short of threatening to veto it as of Wednesday afternoon.
Here's who will be left out once the checks start arriving:
High-wage earners
If your income is too high, you won't get a check. The payments are phased out for Americans at income thresholds based on their 2019 tax returns.
For instance, individuals earning up to $75,000, and couples making less than $150,000 will receive the full, one-time amount of $600, which is half the value of the first round of $1,200 checks issued under the CARES Act in March. The amount drops by $5 for every $100 of income above those income thresholds. It will phase out completely at $87,000 for individuals and $174,000 for couples. If you claimed the head of household filing status on your tax return, you won't get a payment if your adjusted gross income exceeds $124,500.
Unemployed high-wage earners
Eligibility for stimulus checks will be determined by 2019 tax returns, a change from the first round of payments that were based on 2018 or 2019 tax returns. That could change how much you receive and whether you get a second check. If you earned more than $87,000 last year but are unemployed in 2020, you won't be eligible for a payment.
Some people who earned significantly less income this year than they did on their 2019 tax return could be eligible for a refundable tax credit for their second stimulus payment when they file their 2020 tax return, according to Toby Mathis, a partner and attorney at Anderson Law Group in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Students
Students age 17 or older don't qualify for a stimulus check if their parents or guardians claim them as dependents. That means the stimulus excludes millions of high school and college-aged Americans. Their parents also won't get a payment of $600 per child that the new stimulus package offers. It applies only to children 16 and younger. There is no cap on the number of child dependents that a household can claims, so a family of four would receive up to $2,400.
Some elderly and disabled adults
Adult dependents don't qualify for a check, which means an elderly parent or family member living under the care of an adult child that is claimed as a dependent won't get a direct payment.
Some immigrants
Those without Social Security numbers, typically unauthorized immigrants, aren't eligible.
Some immigrants qualify for a stimulus check if they meet the eligibility criteria and have a valid Social Security number. Immigrants with green cards or H-1B and H-2A work visas are eligible for a check.
Nonresident aliens, temporary workers and immigrants in the country illegally aren't eligible.
But mixed-status households, or those where a family member doesn't have a Social Security number but others do, will be eligible for stimulus payments, a key change from the CARES Act. Under that legislation, households that had a single member without a Social Security number were disqualified.

Stingy immigration policy stifles U.S. innovation

What do the founders of Intel, Sun Microsystems and Google -- Andy Grove, Andy Bechtolsheim, Vinod Khosla and Sergey Brin -- have in common with Albert Einstein and Wernher von Braun? All are part of America's tradition of welcoming talented immigrants who have made  significant contributions to our industry.
Einstein changed the way we look at science and energy; von Braun was the father of the U.S. space program; and Grove, Bechtolsheim, Khosla and Brin are among the many giants who have changed the high-tech industry.
The innovative companies they built  created thousands of jobs and have a combined market cap of $250 billion. But our longstanding tradition of being an open door for innovation is at risk.
Today's broken immigration system closes the door on foreign-born innovators. With arbitrary visa limits and clogged processing, opportunity is knocking at our door and we're fumbling with the keys.
It wasn't always this way.  Several of our nation's Nobel laureates are foreign-born. The past half-century of scientific research success that has made our universities the beacon of innovation would not have occurred but for the contributions of foreign-born students. And the efforts of Grove, Bechtolsheim, Khosla and Brin alone have generated thousands of U.S. jobs and hundreds of millions in U.S. tax revenue.
So  why the conflict between our laws and our policy?
First, the world is catching on to the job-creating benefits of a strong math and science education. China and India are graduating hundreds of thousands of engineers each year. In addition, they and other nations have established generous tax incentives to lure research and development into their countries. These factors have made the competition for talent global.
Second, our past success breeds the potential for the next "big thing" in fields such as  biotechnology, nanotechnology and biophysics. By 2012, it's projected that the demand for technical jobs in science and engineering will increase by more than 25%, and 39% in math and computer science. Factor in the tech rebound, and the need will be even greater.
What happened the last time we saw demand for these professionals soar? Congress created a visa program for immigrants who had unique technical knowledge, a bachelor's degree and a job offer in the USA.
Under the current system, the federal government provides 65,000 H-1B visas each year, beginning Oct. 1. Yet the visas made available last October were spoken for almost two months before that, which means our open door for innovation is temporarily closed for 14 months.
For foreign-born students graduating from a U.S. college  in June, the H-1B limitations make it difficult for them to find jobs here.  We're even closing the door on those with H-1Bs visas who seek permanent U.S. residency because of extended delays in a system designed largely in 1990, when our workforce and economic needs were different.
For the U.S. high-tech community, these laws present a difficult choice:  Innovate or perish. If we can't find professionals to do the job here in the USA, many will simply move the job to the qualified workers overseas.
A new study by the National Foundation for American Policy, a non-profit organization, has concluded that the laws are forcing good-paying, job-creating positions offshore. We know that the long-term solution is investing in educational programs  in math, science and engineering. But we won't see the fruits of those investments for at least a decade.
In the short term, we should align our immigration laws with our economic needs.  What Congress does now will determine whether our nation stays competitive in the global economy. Without innovation, we have nothing.

Lack of demand spoiling economy; Fed alone can't fix the USA's problems

The world economy faces massive challenges -- but you sure wouldn't know it by looking at the stock market, which, despite the recent sell-off, remains near record territory.
A poor report on the health of the U.S. economy during the first three months of the year confirms what many already believed --the U.S. economy is stuck in doldrums.
Though some investors and even the Federal Reserve try to blame the weather, our nation's economic malaise stems from a larger, fundamental problem. A problem that neither President Obama nor Fed Chair Janet Yellen seem capable of fixing: a lack of demand.
Without a vibrant consumer to buy their goods and services, U.S. companies are hesitant to invest in the future. As such, they don't hire, and they don't build. The administration likes to tout the hundreds of thousands of jobs the economy has added this year. Let's not kid ourselves. These are lousy, low-paying jobs, and they haven't grown our economy.
A strong U.S. dollar contributes to our economic woes by making U.S. goods increasingly expensive to overseas buyers, which reduces international demand for our products.
If you combine our problems at home with the unraveling of the eurozone, economic challenges in Asia and a decline in commodity prices that hurts developing nations, many fear we have the recipe for a potential worldwide recession the likes of which we haven't seen since the early 1930s.
Yet, unlike the '30s, stock prices are high.
We have the Fed to thank, though that's not necessarily a good thing.
After six years of record low rates and multiple cash injections into our economy, the Fed is still singing the same tune -- and getting nowhere. Wednesday, the Federal Reserve shied away from any indication it will raise rates in June, as originally telegraphed. At this rate, it may well be 2016 before we see any meaningful commitment to raising rates from the Fed. The market likes that. Too much.
The Fed's intentions are good. By keeping rates low, it believes it can stimulate borrowing and investment by encouraging people to take on more risk. Unfortunately, good intentions don't always equal good results. In this case, the Fed is helping to create a market bubble.
Consider this: If investors are unable to earn interest on a safe investment such as a Treasury bond or a bank's certificate of deposit, they'll naturally seek riskier assets to generate income. As long as the Fed continues anchoring the markets with a zero interest rate policy, market participants will continue ignoring fundamentals such as poor Gross Domestic Product reports, a lack of wage inflation and weaker corporate earnings.
While Europe's Central Bank works aggressively to mend the European economy by following the Fed's example of quantitative easing (buying bonds to help inject liquidity into the marketplace), the U.S. dollar keeps getting stronger -- making it nearly impossible for the Fed to raise rates for fear of creating an even stronger dollar, which would result in a bigger drag on international sales.
Quite a conundrum.
Before we put all the blame on Yellen, remember the Fed is being forced into this position, in part because of a lack of leadership in Washington. For the past seven years, business owners have worried about everything from higher health care costs to additional regulation to a government shutdown. These worries have prevented them from investing in new hires and new infrastructure.
We need a commitment from lawmakers to help business owners plan for the future by providing economic incentives such as lower taxes for individuals and corporations, which spur growth. Companies should be allowed to bring back overseas profits without penalties to stimulate investment at home. And Washington needs to increase the number of H1B visas, so we can keep intelligent engineers, mathematicians, scientists and talented foreign entrepreneurs in the USA.
To grow our economy, we need leaders that understand math and economics. Otherwise, the Fed will continue spinning its wheels ... until the markets spin out of control.
If only the old adage, "sell in May and go away" were that simple. It's a losing strategy to fight the Fed, which is why many believe it's worth staying in the market. However, ultimately, lawmakers need to provide a healthier environment for business, as the Fed alone isn't going to be able to generate enough demand to cure this economy and justify high market valuations. As such, investors choosing to stay in this market must remain highly vigilant, highly selective and highly flexible.
Remember this: A market based on artificial stimulus is not a sustainable market. Eventually, bubbles always burst.

Joe Biden's victory  will provide a boost to a U.S. economy battered by the COVID-19 pandemic as his bold spending plans and stauncher support for trade and immigration more than offset the drawbacks of new taxes and regulations, top economists say.
Biden's blueprint will bring back the 11 million jobs and $670 billion in annualized gross domestic product wiped out - and not yet recovered - in the crisis more rapidly than if President Donald Trump had won a second term, analysts say.
"Biden's policies are the right ones to address the economic crises created by the pandemic," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's analytics.
Yet the scope of the economic be-nefits delivered by Biden's agenda hinges on whether Republicans keep narrow control of the Senate as now seems likely, or Democrats gain a slim edge.
The final results many not be clear until early next year because of runoff races.
Here's how a Biden plan could affect the economy:
COVID-19 stimulus package
Biden has voiced support for a robust relief measure that includes another federal bonus to weekly unemployment benefits, more aid for struggling small businesses and financially distressed states, and another round of stimulus checks to most households.
The big question: Which party has the majority in the Senate? Last month, the Democratic House passed a $2.2 trillion package, while the Republican Senate has favored a $500 billion plan.
If Republicans keep control, lawmakers likely would approve a $1.5 trillion stimulus, possibly late this year, according to Moody's Analytics and Oxford Economics. If the Democrats wrest control, Zandi expects a $2 trillion package that could match the $600 jobless aid provided to jobless Americans earlier this year instead of a reduced amount.
Longer-term spending
Biden is proposing $7.3 trillion in new spending over 10 years, including upgrading the nation's roads, bridges and highways; building a clean energy economy; investing in research and development to bolster manufacturing; ensuring the government and its contractors buy American products; providing tuition-free community college; ensuring access to affordable child care and universal preschool; and providing aid for Americans to buy or rent homes. The flurry of programs will create new economic output, generate millions of jobs, help workers better prepare for high-skilled positions and increase the nation's  output per worker, Zandi says.
If Democrats narrowly win the Senate but Republicans can block major legislation with 40 votes,  Democrats will have to compromise, likely trimming the $7.3 trillion blueprint to about $4 trillion, Zandi says. Oxford economist Gregory Daco foresees a more dramatic cut to about $3 trillion.
And if Republicans keep Senate control, just a sliver of the proposals likely would pass,  Zandi says.
Taxes
To help pay for the massive outlays, Biden plans to raise taxes by about $4 trillion over the next decade. He proposes eliminating loopholes for people earning more than $400,000; subjecting incomes above $400,000 to the 12.4% Social Security payroll tax; and phasing out itemized deductions at incomes of $400,000. He also wants to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and tax capital gains and dividends at ordinary rates for incomes above $1 million.
Under a slim Democratic majority in the Senate, Zandi figures Republicans would oppose the individual tax hikes and only the corporate tax increase would pass. Daco believes Republicans would rebuff the expanded payroll tax and agree to bumping up the corporate tax rate to just 24% instead of 28%.
New taxes likely would ding business profits and discourage some investment,  Zandi says. Oxford, however, says the effects on business activity should be "negligible."
Both Zandi and Daco also figure Biden would delay any tax increases to later in his term, after the economy is well on the path to recovery.
And if Republicans keep their Senate majority? Don't expect any tax increases, the economists say.
Immigration
Biden doesn't need Congress's approval to reverse a cascade of Trump executive actions, and economists say that's precisely what he will do. Those include a ban on travel from several Muslim-majority countries and a sharp reduction in the annual cap on the number of refugees permitted in the U.S., Oxford Economics says.
Biden also supports sweeping immigration reform, which likely would boost the number of immigrants entering, and staying in, the country. Zandi also expects a looser policy on H-1B visas for high-skilled foreign workers.
All told, average annual immigration to the U.S. likely would slowly climb back to about 1 million after falling to about 750,000, the economists say. That would boost the population and labor supply, increasing consumer spending, productivity and economic growth, they say.
Trade
Biden has taken a tough stance on trade with China and wouldn't immediately lift the $360 billion in tariffs Trump set on Chinese imports, Daco and Zandi say.
But unlike Trump, Biden has said he wants to rally U.S. allies to confront China. And while Trump almost certainly would have escalated the trade war, Biden likely would remove some of the tariffs,  Daco says. Zandi believes all the levies will be gone by 2023.
That would eliminate a tax on American shoppers who buy Chinese imports. And it likely would prompt China to remove the retaliatory tariffs it has levied on American shipments to that country, juicing U.S. industrial production and exports.
Regulations
Biden has said he'll roll back much of Trump's cuts to regulations, especially environmental rules for the power and auto industries, as he ramps up a plan to address climate change and promote clean energy.
Daco says new regulations likely would discourage some business investment and hiring.
"The oil and gas sector could see a rough ride," says economist Troy Ludtka of research firm Natixis.
Zandi, however, says there's no evidence regulations have such negative effects on business activity.
Minimum wage
Biden supports a Democratic proposal in Congress to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15. But with just a slim Senate majority, Democrats would not be able to overcome a filibuster.
That likely would mean no minimum wage hike or a small bump that won't have a meaningful impact, Zandi says. And a Republican Senate would be highly unlikely to approve a bump in base pay, Zandi says.
The economic effects of a minimum wage increase are mixed. About 30 million mostly lower-income households would benefit from higher pay, increasing their spending power, Oxford Economics says.
At the same time, that economic gain could be offset as some businesses hire fewer workers and pass their higher labor costs to consumers, hurting consumption, Oxford says.

Legislators open loopholes in immigration law; Exceptions made for foreign doctors, athletic prospects

WASHINGTON -- Late last year, with little fanfare and no roll call votes, Congress and President Bush reached agreement on an immigration bill.
Not the long-awaited legislation that would determine the fate of as many as 12 million illegal immigrants in the USA, create a border security and employment verification system, and alleviate backlogs that have kept some relatives of U.S. citizens waiting decades. Lawmakers will reopen the debate on that measure this month after failing to reach an agreement last year.
The last Congress was able to act with dispatch, however, to alleviate one pressing immigration problem -- one vexing baseball and hockey teams.
Thanks to the COMPETE Act, signed into law by President Bush on Dec. 22, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League will be able to fill their farm teams with as many promising prospects as they can find in Latin America, the Caribbean, Canada and elsewhere across the globe.
Up until last year, teams that wanted to try out foreign players in their minor league system had to apply for immigration visas under the increasingly oversubscribed H-2B category, used for seasonal workers in occupations ranging from landscaping to fisheries to hotel housekeeping. Those visas are capped at 66,000 a year.
The visa crunch that brought professional sports leagues to Washington for help and the way Congress handled the problem demonstrates the complexity of the nation's immigration system and the political difficulties of fixing it.
Rather than tackling the big question of whether the U.S. economy needs foreign workers and how many should be permitted into the country each year, the nation's lawmakers have created loopholes and exemptions that circumvent caps on some work visas. Buried in larger, unrelated pieces of legislation, most have sailed through Congress with little or no debate. Recent examples:
*A measure that annually adds 20,000 H-1B visas to the 65,000-a-year limit for foreigners who have earned graduate degrees from U.S. universities was tucked into the 2004 omnibus appropriations bill that provided funding for more than 10 federal agencies. The H-1B category was designed for college-educated foreign workers. The same bill contained a provision allowing each state to request up to 30 foreign doctors a year if they are willing to work in an underserved area.
*A 2005 bill providing emergency funding for the Gulf Coast, Iraq and Afghanistan contained a provision for a one-year exemption from the H-2B visa cap for seasonal workers, such as nursery and hotel employees, who held a job in the USA sometime during the previous three years. The same measure provided 50,000 green cards for foreign nurses.
*The one-year exemption for returning seasonal workers was made permanent in the 2006 defense appropriations bill.
Congress also has shifted groups of workers from one visa category to another, in particular to ease pressure on the two work visas that are capped: H-1B and H-2B.
In 2006, the State Department issued more than 32,000 visas in a category created especially for Australians who have job offers in the USA. Congress created a work visa for citizens of Chile and Singapore under international trade agreements.
There are so many types of visas that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service is running out of letters of the alphabet to name them. A proposed immigration bill the Bush administration is discussing with Congress would create Y and Z visas to admit more temporary workers and grant legal status to those in the country illegally.
The system is "enormously complex," said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who chairs the House immigration subcommittee. "It's very easy for people to fall afoul of the laws inadvertently."
The complexity also creates opportunities. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine., took advantage of one when she introduced the COMPETE Act last year to help two teams in her home state: the Lewiston MAINEiacs, a junior hockey league team that had to delay its home opener because of problems gaining H-2B visas for players, and the Portland Sea Dogs, a member of the Boston Red Sox baseball farm system.
Since the enactment of Collins' bill, minor league hockey and baseball players have been able to take advantage of the unlimited number of P-1 visas, which were formerly reserved for major leaguers.
"We saw a big difference this year," Peter Greenberg, a New York agent who represents some of baseball's biggest Latin stars, told USA TODAY. "Now, I think you'll see the number of foreign players go up dramatically."
Immigration lawyers say their clients want the same chance to hire the world's best.
William Stock, a Philadelphia immigration lawyer, said a pharmaceutical company he represents will outsource an entire department to Great Britain if one prospective employee misses out in this year's H-1B visa lottery.
"There's a global war for talent," Stock said. "We're fighting with one hand tied behind our back."

The Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders Show; Voters yearn for outsider cred

Political parties exist, first and foremost, to serve the interests of the insiders, while doling out just enough in the way of favors and ideological satisfaction to keep the party outsiders on the reservation. But when the members of the "Outer Party" feel sufficiently ignored, a champion appears who will take their interests to heart, or at least sound as if he does.
That's what's happening in both parties with the rise of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and businessman Donald Trump, R-Himself. Each, in his own way, speaks to the concerns of constituencies within his party (and, to some degree, the other party) that are being ignored or dismissed by the insiders.
Sanders recently went after the Obama administration on inequality and unemployment. He noted that although the official government unemployment rate is 5.4%, the real unemployment figure, including those who have given up looking for work or who are involuntarily working part-time, is 10.5%.
He's speaking to a concern evident to ordinary Democrats around the country but concealed by the Obama administration's gauzy proclamations of economic recovery. The New York Times recently noted that the benefits of this "recovery" have gone almost entirely to the rich. "In the first three years of the current expansion, incomes actually fell for the bottom 90% of earners, even as they rose nicely for the top 10%. The result: The top 10% captured an impossible-seeming 116% of income gains during that span. ... One percent of the population, in the first three years of the expansion, took home 95% of income gains."
Sanders might not be the dream candidate, but he draws enthusiastic crowds who are grateful that someone is speaking to their concerns.
Likewise, Trump. His signature issue is immigration. The GOP establishment likes open borders because big corporate donors want cheap labor. (The Democratic establishment likes open borders because immigrants usually vote Democratic.) But many ordinary Americans wonder what's in it for them. More immigrants means more competition for jobs, pushing wages down, whether it's at entry-level unskilled jobs or at the higher-level tech jobs where employers abuse H1B visas to bring in cheap foreign labor.
Most GOP pols are afraid to touch the issue and risk offending big donors or Hispanic voters. Trump doesn't care. Two weeks ago, the immigration debate was about college-bound "DREAMers." Now it is about career-criminal undocumented immigrants who kill women. Trump might not be an ideal candidate either, but, yet again, ignored voters are grateful someone is taking up their cause.
Democrats and Republicans are learning, again, that you'll feel the pain when you ignore voters.

Trump made big promises after elected. Did he deliver?; Taxes, judges, deregulation, climate: A closer look

President Donald Trump says he's not a politician. As proof, the real estate developer points to the promises he made both on the 2016 campaign and early in his term - and, he says, delivered.
Poll: Biden and Latino voters
Joe Biden holds a slight lead over President Donald Trump in this key demographic in Florida, though he is foundering with Cuban voters. 4A
The Backstory
Here's what our reporters are watching
Editor-in-chief Nicole Carroll talks to USA TODAY Network journalists who are covering swing states, and explains how our newsrooms will be reporting on voting, correcting misinformation and providing accurate results. 3A
"Unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises," he said during his State of the Union speech this year.
So what were his major promises?
The appointment of conservative justices to federal courts. Broad tax cuts. Building a border wall on the southern border and making Mexico pay for it. Massive deregulation. Replacing Obamacare with a health coverage plan that's "far less expensive and far better." Bringing back manufacturing. Reinvigorating fading industries, such as coal and steel. Renegotiating trade deals in a way that helps the U.S. Moving the Israeli Embassy to Jerusalem. Curbing immigration. Reducing the national debt. Withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.
The USA TODAY Network looked at promises large and small, national and exceedingly local, that Trump made on the trail and early in his term.
He has delivered on a number of them, including tax cuts, conservative judges, deregulation, the climate accord and the Israeli Embassy. Some have been partly accomplished, such as trade deals, the border wall and defeating ISIS. Other pledges have yet to be realized, such as bringing back coal and steel. And some have gone in the wrong direction, such as reducing the national debt and bringing back manufacturing.
Larry Sabato, director of Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said Trump "has certainly fulfilled some promises," especially the appointment of conservative judges that have won him the continued admiration of white evangelicals who are expected to again support him in overwhelming numbers.
But the president also tends to exaggerate his record of delivering, he said.
"If you listen to Trump, he's fulfilled all promises and has done so perfectly," Sabato wrote in an email to USA TODAY. "In other words, he can't be relied on to tell the truth and only people who haven't paid attention over the past four years or are members of his worshipful base would believe otherwise."
But, "how's that border wall paid for by Mexico coming?" he asked, a reference to one campaign pledge Trump has not yet made good on.
Conservative justices
Trump delivered resoundingly on the pledge to nominate conservative judges to the nation's Supreme Court.
With the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, Trump has become the first president since Richard Nixon to name three judges to the court in a first term.
Barrett joins Neil Gorsuch, who was confirmed in 2017, and Brett Kavanaugh, confirmed in 2018.
In addition to the Supreme Court, Trump has named more than 200 judges to district and appellate courts, helping the GOP's efforts to remake the federal bench.

Border and immigration issues
Trump partially accomplished his signature campaign promise of building a wall along the entire 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border to stop drugs and people from entering illegally. But it looks different than what he envisioned, and Mexico is not paying for it - U.S. taxpayers are.
After he won the 2016 election, Trump abandoned the promise of a solid, concrete wall spanning the entire border, in favor of 30-foot steel slats known as bollards at strategic sections of the U.S.-Mexico border.
As of Oct. 19, construction crews have completed installation of 371 miles of new fencing, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Most of the fencing is replacing older lower fencing or vehicle barriers that were easier to climb over or under.
Trump has not accomplished his promise of reforming the legal immigration system. In May 2019, he unveiled legislation that would significantly revamp the system into a merit-based one that would mostly award green cards to immigrants based on education and skills rather than being closely related to legal permanent residents or U.S. citizens. But Trump's proposed legislation never gained traction in Congress.
Trump has used his executive powers to find other ways to restrict legal immigration without the help of Congress, experts say. His administration has implemented a new "public charge rule" that makes it more difficult for some immigrants who have used public benefits in the past to receive green cards. The administration also has increased vetting for H-1B visas, which companies use to bring in high-skilled workers from other countries.

Health care
In 2016, Trump promised "great health care" for any American who is sick, and at affordable prices. Nonpartisan experts say health care costs have continued to rise during his term.
Trump repeatedly cited premium increases among Affordable Care Act plans and limited competition among insurers to describe the system as failing, and to argue it should be replaced. But his administration never proposed an alternative, and experts say the proposals put forward by GOP leaders in Congress did not live up to Trump's promise that he would provide great health care at a fraction of the cost.
Trump's push to repeal the ACA ultimately failed in 2017, when three Republican senators broke ranks and voted with Democrats to preserve the law.
- Zac Anderson, Sarasota Herald-Tribune
Michigan manufacturing
Trump ran in 2016 on a promise to restore and protect manufacturing jobs, and nowhere did he make that guarantee more fervently than in Michigan.
Four years later, however, neither Michigan nor the U.S. has seen any economy-changing resurgence in manufacturing, despite gains in other parts of the country prior to the pandemic.
But Trump did have some victories. As promised, his administration renegotiated NAFTA. Also, two new major assembly facilities have been announced since he took office: a Jeep plant in Detroit and a $700 million plant at Ford's Rouge complex. General Motors has announced it's investing $150 million in its existing Michigan plants.
- Todd Spangler, Detroit Free Press
Pennsylvania coal and steel
Trump's promises of rejuvenating coal and steel industries in Pennsylvania have not exactly come to fruition.
There are fewer coal-mining jobs since he took office in 2017. He followed through on promises to cut environmental regulations to benefit coal, but experts say it has not been enough to offset other issues, such as falling demand, a shift to more environmentally friendly renewable energy sources and competition from cheaper natural gas.
Trump's tariffs on steel have leveled the playing field against cheaper imports, but the taxes have taken a toll on U.S. companies that import steel. Jobs in Pennsylvania's iron and steel mills and ferroalloy manufacturing rose some during Trump's first term but have fallen amid the pandemic.
- J.D. Prose, Pocono Record
Taxes and national debt
Trump campaigned on a promise of simplifying and slashing taxes, especially for the working and middle classes. Passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which amounted to the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code in decades, did bring tax cuts. While the bill helped average families, it steered the bulk of relief to the richest.
The legislation is projected to add nearly $2 trillion to the national debt over the next decade despite Trump's assertions that the law will pay for itself through economic growth. So while the bill helped him deliver to a larger degree on tax cuts, it made his pledge to eliminate the national debt within eight years that much tougher.
As of Oct. 14, total U.S. debt stood at $27.1 trillion, up from $19.95 trillion on Jan. 20, 2017, the first day of his presidency.
- Ledyard King, USA TODAY
Ohio manufacturing
Less than a year into his presidency, Trump urged those attending a rally to stay in the Mahoning Valley because the jobs that made northeast Ohio into a production powerhouse would be coming back. Three years later, those jobs have not returned, and in 2019, General Motors shuttered its assembly plant. Manufacturing in the Youngstown/Warren/Boardman area is at its worst since the Great Recession, a level where it has hovered even before the pandemic.

Foreigners seeking high-skilled worker visas hope to beat the odds; About half will get them; politics may be reason

WASHINGTON -- From high-heeled fashion models to high-skilled techies, foreign workers are waiting this month to hear whether they've won an unprecedented lottery for temporary U.S. work visas.
The lottery is in response to an overwhelming demand for 65,000 high-skilled worker visas. More than 123,000 applications arrived at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the first 48 hours after the April 1 filing date. Immigration officials cut off processing any others at that point.
For minor league baseball and hockey players, however, the wait is over: Congress last year exempted them from a cap on work visas.
Congress over the years has quietly created new categories and crafted exemptions to get around limits on some of the work visas most in demand. The lawmakers have raised the limit on students with graduate degrees from U.S. universities and eliminated the cap on foreigners at non-profit research institutions and professionals from U.S. free trade partners.
The result is what Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., calls a "Rube Goldberg, ad hoc system" that can be daunting for both immigrants and would-be employers.
The demand for work visas underscores one of the issues confronting Congress as it prepares to resume a contentious debate over proposed immigration legislation this month: Should the USA permit more foreigners to work here?
"I'd like to see America bring in the smartest people from everywhere and let them stay as long as they want," says Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, a leading advocate of immigration reform.
Others express caution. "The more people there are for those jobs, the worse off American workers will be," says Harvard University economist George Borjas.
It's not easy for foreigners to come to the USA to work. More than 1 million people become permanent legal residents each year, most sponsored by family members. The number that can be sponsored by employers is limited to 140,000 a year.
That has created a demand for more temporary worker visas. Last year, immigration officials were able to accept H-1B applications until May 26 and award the popular visas for high-skilled workers on a first-come, first-serve basis. This year, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services stopped taking applications after 48 hours and let a computer pick the winners.
Spokesman Chris Bentley said notifications should be made within the next few weeks.
Katie Ford, head of Ford Models, the prestigious New York agency, said she has lost business because H-1B visas weren't available for models. The industry is lobbying to get out from under the cap.
"This is a huge issue for us," Ford said. "It's easier for a client to find a model internationally and shoot somewhere else."

You'll forget San Bernardino; My hometown, San Bernardino, was already in crisis before the attack

There was no hashtag or meme or Facebook artwork on Aug. 1, 2012, when San Bernardino, Calif., filed for bankruptcy protection after a long fiscal breakdown. Massive budget cuts followed. The police force was reduced by a quarter, and murders predictably went up. City Attorney James Penman later told residents at a public meeting to "lock your doors and load your guns."
San Bernardino, where I grew up and where President Obama is scheduled to visit Friday, was already famous for violent crime and drug-dealing. So when I heard the words "there was a shooting in San Bernardino" on Dec. 2, my initial thought was: What's new?
The violence is why people leave. I moved from San Bernardino to neighboring Redlands, hoping to escape.
And so I wound up living about 75 yards away, and nine doors down, from the townhouse rented by Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik. I walked my dogs by the place but don't remember ever seeing them.
That Wednesday, the day of the attack that killed 14 people at the Inland Regional Center, I stayed inside and listened to my hometown next door become a worldwide talking point for the first time in my life.
An indifferent world
My childhood friends and I, all living elsewhere now, texted each other. We shook our heads at the misspelled #SanBernadinoShooting (the second "r" in Bernardino had disappeared). We noted the irony that such a hashtag could have described most days in the city, only now the world was no longer indifferent.
Within hours, MRAPs -- military-grade mine-resistant vehicles -- were circling my neighborhood. Helicopters were overhead. I am used to these vehicles and noises and sirens. San Bernardino had come to me. By night I was locked down, and by next morning the area was a federal investigation site.
Two days after the massacre, I walked outside and found that the police tape had been taken down. I could move freely, so I chose to go see my neighbors' house in person. I stood at the edge of the news media pit and watched landlord Doyle Miller peel back plywood on the home he rented to Farook and Malik. Watching news crews crawl through the shooters' realm was a perfect crystallization of how fast the media eye flickers.
Many times last week, I was asked by reporters "what I would do now" and how I felt about Farook and Malik "living in my neighborhood."
Well, I live amidst all kinds of people here from all kinds of places. Some of these people are older, Caucasian and have lawn signs for Republican candidates. Then there are young families. I am good friends with a Tunisian family a few doors down. A single father lives across the street from me; we get along because we're both young.
A Diverse neighborhood
Generally, I don't know most of my neighbors because people are always coming or going. We live within walking distance of the headquarters of ESRI -- the largest global mapping company -- which has an international workforce and brings in employees on H-1B visas. Many ESRI employees are of South-Asian or North-African descent. Seeing men and women in traditional garb is not different. This is why Farook and Malik fit in.
After the shooting and the home search, I was interviewed by a Los Angeles news station. "How does that make you feel," the anchor asked me, "that they were right there? That they had bombs?"
My answer: "That's the world we live in, I guess."
Was I shocked that terrorists lived in my neighborhood? Not really. Growing up in San Bernardino, you live in a radius of violence, so you come to expect horror being within walking distance.
But I worry what will become of San Bernardino when the national conversation turns elsewhere. Won't things go back to the violent normal?
I ask myself where the calls for prayer, the memes and assertive Facebook posts were before the Inland Regional Center shooting -- the darkest moment of a tragedy that has been going on for a long time, in slow motion.

Visa rules tightened for foreign workers; Trump administration cites security concerns

The Trump administration changed its rules for highly skilled foreign workers who want to live and work in the United States as part of the so-called H-1B visa program, the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security announced Tuesday.
The changes, which the Trump administration has characterized as part of its goal to protect American workers, mean employers will need to commit to higher salaries for those they want to hire and visa applicants will have to have a "specialty occupation" that more narrowly fits their formal qualifications. Visa lengths could also shorten.
"We have entered an era in which economic security is an integral part of homeland security," Acting Department of Homeland Secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement. "We must do everything we can within the bounds of the law to make sure the American worker is put first."
The policy changes have been discussed since 2017 and will be effective within 60 days. Current immigration law allows for about 85,000 H-1B visas each year, according to U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Ken Cuccinelli, the No. 2 ranking official at the Department of Homeland Secretary, told reporters on a conference call that he expects about one-third of H-1B visa applications would be rejected under the new set of rules.
The Journal additionally reported that the overhaul of the H-1B visa program could disproportionately affect technology workers. Under the new rule, for example, someone who applies for a job as a software developer wouldn't be awarded an H-1B visa if that person has a degree in engineering or some other non-computer-programming field.
The action comes less than a week after the Trump administration slashed the number of refugees allowed to resettle in the U.S. to a new low next year. The changes permit no more than 15,000 people fleeing war, violence and persecution across the globe to make a new home in America. The U.S. State Department announced the cap.

Gates urges more tech worker visas; Some in Congress want tighter rules

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates on Wednesday asked Congress to make it easier for tech companies to hire foreign workers -- even though some members of Congress want to make it harder.
Gates, testifying before the House Committee on Science and Technology, said that the USA faces "a critical shortfall of skilled scientists and engineers." Improvements in education would help, but more visas for skilled workers are desperately needed, he said.
He wants Congress to raise the number of the most common type of skilled worker visa, called an H-1B. So do many other big tech companies, including Google, Intel and Hewlett-Packard.
Critics such as Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., want to make H-1Bs harder to obtain. They say visa holders take American jobs and reduce wages by working for less than their U.S. counterparts.
This battle, waging for years, is at a stalemate. The number of the main type of H-1B visas has not changed since 2002. But neither side plans to back down.
Insufficient visas mean that "many U.S. firms, including Microsoft, have been forced to locate staff in countries that welcome skilled foreign workers" to stay competitive, Gates said.
Rohrabacher replied that Gates is "totally insensitive and unsympathetic to average working people who are being displaced by foreign workers."
Congress allocates about 65,000 standard H-1B visas each fiscal year. Exemptions and related visas often raise the number of skilled worker permits to nearly 130,000, says Ron Hira, a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology and author of Outsourcing America.
But demand still far outstrips supply. In fiscal 2007, which began Oct. 1, 2006, the main type of H-1B visa was used up by early April.
Although Gates spoke of highly skilled specialists, the average H-1B worker has a bachelor's degree, was born in India and makes about $55,000 a year, says the most recent data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service. (The average U.S. tech worker's salary is more than $74,500, says career site Dice.com.)
Many of the companies who hire H-1B visa holders are also from India, although they have large U.S. operations. Huge outsourcing firms such as Wipro and Infosys are among the biggest H-1B users.
That's a problem, says Paul Kostek, a vice president with IEEE-USA, a trade group representing U.S. engineers and scientists. Since many visa holders are not working for U.S. companies, raising the cap will not help America be more competitive, he said.
Rohrabacher is co-sponsor of a bill that would make it tougher for foreign workers to qualify for an H-1B. Hira says other reforms are needed. He advocates higher wages for H-1B holders and audits that will require companies to prove that they tried to hire U.S.  workers before seeking H-1Bs. The visas "can have a positive effect, but let's mend (the program)," he says.

Foreign start-ups try to pitch way into USA; Austin competition aimed at helping entrepreneurs break into the U.S. market

Jet-lagged and nervous, Eirini Malliaraki, 25, stood in front of a panel of judges and fielded a barrage of questions about revenue streams, patents, employee targets and product development.
It was worth it.
Malliaraki was participating in a "Fast-Pitch Competition" for foreign entrepreneurs on the first day of South by Southwest Interactive here.
The event was organized by International Accelerator, an Austin-based fund and mentorship program that helps foreign-born start-ups break into the U.S. market.
If selected, the London-based start-up she co-founded, Filisia, will get a shot at relocating to the U.S. "It's a big market and easier to get funding," Malliaraki said. "We'd like to come to the States at some point."
Foreign-born entrepreneurs and start-ups are playing a growing role at SXSW and in the U.S. tech industry. Around 20% of the nearly 34,000 badge-holders that participate in SXSW Interactive are foreigners, from countries like Norway, Brazil, Japan, Canada and Mexico, said Peter Lewis, SXSW's manager of international engagement.
Also, for the first time in SXSW's 30-year history, the Mexican consulate general in Austin transformed the local Emma Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center in downtown Austin into a celebration of foreign-born entrepreneurship. The concept, called "Casa Mexico," showcased Mexican rock bands, booths promoting foreign innovations, foreign dignitaries and the International Accelerator pitch competition.
SXSW organizers are so keen on recruiting foreigners to its yearly gathering that it employs five representatives around the world with the year-round task of recruiting more foreign techies and companies, Lewis said.
"They play a huge part," Lewis said. "It is imperative for us to stay relevant and to reach out to international audiences."
Foreign-born entrepreneurs have left a deep mark in the U.S. tech industry. Some of the industry's biggest names, including PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, and Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who came to the U.S. as a child, are foreign-born. In fact, one-fourth of all technology and engineering companies created between 2006 and 2010 were founded by foreign-born entrepreneurs, according to a report by the Kauffman Foundation.
But relocating to the U.S. to launch a start-up is becoming an increasingly difficult endeavor, due to an immigration system that doesn't recognize their value, said Jason Finkelman, an Austin-based national immigration attorney who helps IT foreigners come to the U.S.
Foreign entrepreneurs often apply for an H-1B visa, which grants temporary residence to professionals. But the odds of obtaining those, which are dispersed via a lottery, are increasingly slim, he said.
President Obama in recent years hinted of launching a "start-up visa" aimed at foreign-born entrepreneurs, but so far nothing has come out of it -- and nothing will in the near future as immigration has become a hot topic this election year, Finkelman said.
The issue of H-1B visas made it into recent recent presidential election debates.
"We have an archaic immigration system here put into place decades ago that never took into consideration the tech boom," he said. "As of now, there is literally no visa option for foreign-born entrepreneurs to come here and start a business."
Angelos Angelou first noticed the immigration roadblocks while recruiting businesses for the Austin Chamber of Commerce.
In 2014, he started the International Accelerator, which invests in and mentors foreign start-ups and helps them navigate the legal thicket to reach U.S. soil. The accelerator is currently working with 10 companies trying to move to the U.S. "They represent the most ambitious class of their country," Angelou said. "These are folks bringing capital and creating jobs. They're not stealing anyone's job."
At the pitch competition at Casa Mexico, judges heard five-minute pitches from more than 60 start-ups from 10 countries. Five finalists will get a shot of joining International Accelerator's stable of start-ups.
Stamatis Astra, 47, of Greek descent living in Boston, pitched his health care start-up, Stridoc. He's building the company in Greece, where engineers and rents are cheaper, but hopes to one day relocate it to the U.S. "It's the Holy Grail," he said.

GOP senators ask Trump to restrict worker visas for now

WASHINGTON - Four Republican senators asked President Donald Trump to suspend issuance of guest worker visas until next year or "until employment has returned to normal levels" because of the coronavirus pandemic's impact on the economy.
The senators, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, argued in a letter dated May 7, first reported by Politico, that the visa suspensions would be "critical to protecting American workers as our economy gets back on its feet."
They requested a halt to all non-immigrant guest worker visas for 60days, with exceptions granted for agriculture and other critical industries. After the 60 days, the senators said, they want a halt placed on the following visa categories:
H-2B visas for nonagricultural seasonal workers such as ski resort employees.
H-1B visas for "specialty positions."
Optional Practical Training, which extends student visas after graduation.
EB-5 investor visas.
The senators said American students would be forced to compete against international students in a tight job market, and the suspension of the visa categories would give younger Americans and recent college graduates the opportunity to compete for jobs that might otherwise go to immigrants. They urged Trump in their letter to "keep the American worker in mind" and "limit the importation of unnecessary guest workers" while the economy recovered.
The Trump administration has moved to further restrict immigration during the coronavirus pandemic by limiting travel into the USA, stopping most visa processing and speeding up the return of undocumented workers to their home countries.
Trump signed an executive order creating immigration restrictions in late April, but the executive order provided exemptions for agriculture, health care, public safety and other industries.

Teachers trapped in a maze; Filipino educators held in 'servitude' to agency that got them U.S. jobs, federal complaint says

BATON ROUGE -- It has been more than two years since Ingrid Cruz aced a middle-of-the-night video interview in Manila, borrowed $10,000 from her parents and flew halfway around the world to take a job here teaching middle school science.
She was seeking that most American of dreams: a new life, and opportunities she couldn't approach back home. But along the way, Cruz says, she has endured intimidation, humiliation, extortion and a long, painful separation from her young daughters.
Cruz is one of more than 300 teachers imported to Louisiana from the Philippines since 2007, a group of educators who say collectively they paid millions of dollars in cash to a Filipino recruiting firm, PARS International Placement Agency, and its sister company, Los Angeles-based Universal Placement International.
Cases like those of Cruz and others prompted the American Federation of Teachers and its state affiliate, the Louisiana Federation of Teachers, to file a complaint on Sept. 30 with the state Workforce Commission and attorney general. On Oct. 20, AFT filed a lengthier complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor. The unions allege the companies kept the teachers in "virtual servitude" by holding onto their U.S. work visas unless they kept paying inflated fees, commissions and rents.
Teachers paid upward of $16,000 apiece -- about four times what they could earn annually as teachers in the Philippines -- to get and keep jobs with public schools here.
USA TODAY was unsuccessful in repeated attempts since Oct. 16 to get a response to the allegations from Lourdes "Lulu" Navarro, owner of Universal, or a spokesman.
The situation underscores the vulnerabilities of a small but growing corner of teacher recruitment: the H-1B visa program, which brought an estimated 6,000 teachers to the USA last year to fill hard-to-staff jobs in subjects such as math, foreign languages and special education. An estimated 19,000 migrant teachers work in U.S. schools, according to AFT, which last month warned of "widespread and egregious" abuses of imported teachers.
"I'm very concerned that there are more places like this," says American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten. "Even if it was an isolated incident, it would be horrible, but my hunch right now is that it's not isolated."
H-1Bs are reserved for skilled professionals. The law overseeing them relies heavily on employers to protect against fraud and abuse. In this case, critics contend that several Louisiana school districts -- including East Baton Rouge, Jefferson, Caddo and the state-controlled Recovery School District (RSD) in New Orleans -- at best were negligent in not looking out for the best interests of teachers.
"At some point there was an issue of vetting that was not done," says LFT president Steve Monaghan.
If they violated state or federal labor laws, the districts could face substantial penalties: Federal law says they could be on the hook for millions in fees. Already, the Caddo Parish school district in northwestern Louisiana  has agreed to pay $1,660 to each of the district's 43 teachers recruited by Universal -- and has reserved $400,000 for "reimbursement for any potential claims sustained" by teachers.
Before they set foot on a plane in the Philippines, most of the teachers put down cash for a placement fee set at 20% of their expected first-year salary in Louisiana. In a few districts, the teachers stood to earn $40,000.
Federal law prohibits charging most fees to H-1B workers -- employers are supposed to pay them. If they charge any fees, employers aren't allowed to collect them until workers draw their first paycheck in the USA.
Hard to say no
The teachers interviewed say they knew they were being charged an excessive amount. But for the possibility of earning nearly $40,000 a year -- most of which they hoped to send back to their families -- they scrambled to sell cars, mortgage homes, borrow from friends and family and, in a few cases, take out bank loans at inflated interest rates. One teacher sold a steer from his family farm.
"Here's an opportunity for you to grow and pursue your dreams, get a better profession and a better opportunity for your kids," says Cruz, 30, one of a few of the teachers willing to speak on the record about the case. "It would be impractical not to go for it."
High school math teacher Ian Cainglet remembers a wave of fees that just kept coming and coming: a $1,000 "marketing fee," then, a week later, a $3,920 "processing fee." A week later came a $595 "evaluation and transcript" fee, then $100 for a classroom management seminar in Manila that Cainglet thought was useless.
"You would just find a way to produce that money," he says.
Says teacher Bernard Pagusara, "We're thinking, 'If we go to America, it's going to end there.' " .
It didn't.
In interviews and sworn statements, dozens of teachers say things deteriorated once they landed at Los Angeles International Airport.
After a series of flights lasting up to 16 hours, they say, Universal president  Navarro and her employees met the teachers at LAX and took them to get Social Security cards and U.S. checking accounts.
Then Navarro, herself a Filipino, presented them with a second contract -- this time for Universal's share of their placement. It usually amounted to 10% of both their first- and second-year salaries. They'd already paid PARS, run by Navarro's brother, Emilio Villarba, 20% of their first year's salary in cash before leaving the Philippines. Now they were asked to give Navarro more, payable in back-dated monthly checks -- due immediately.
Anyone who didn't sign was threatened with instant deportation, Cruz and others say in their statements.
Teachers say they repeatedly were forced to weigh two unacceptable options: Move forward and pay more in hopes of getting a good job -- or refuse, go back to the Philippines and face a mountain of debt with no job.
"We were already in deep, deep trouble with debts because we were paying all these people," says Luzellene Perez, a teacher in Jefferson Parish, near New Orleans.
All of them boarded their flights to Louisiana on schedule.
Crossing the line
For the East Baton Rouge Parish teachers, Navarro signed leases on their behalf for shared apartments at a run-down complex known as the Savoy. On a recent visit to one unit, roaches dotted tile shower stalls and scattered inside a kitchen cabinet when a teacher opened it.
The complex advertises two-bedroom apartments starting at $815 a month. The teachers say Navarro collected $310 a month from each teacher -- four of them sharing a two-bedroom apartment paid a total of $1,240.
At the height of its commitment to Universal last year, the complex housed 160 teachers.
Meanwhile, teachers over the past two years have devoted much of their salary to debt payments. For Cainglet, they eat up nearly his entire take-home paycheck of $2,100 a month: After $1,950 in loan payments and rent, he's left with $150. "And I've still got to send money home to my family."
Most H-1B visa holders keep the visas for three years, with a chance to renew for another three. And unless a broker is paying the worker's salary, the law requires the employer to pay any fees and ensure that a worker's visa is renewed, says lawyer John Miano, a fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Immigration Studies.
In the Louisiana teachers' case, allowing Navarro to apply for the visas may have crossed the line "from questionable to illegal," he says.
In most cases, Universal served as a free recruiter. It also apparently paid for officials from at least two districts to fly to Manila to meet prospective teachers.
East Baton Rouge schools' general counsel, Domoine Rutledge, says the district "does not have any formal relationship" with Universal, but records in the case show that the company in 2007 wrote a $20,241.90 check to the district that equaled the cost of sending seven district officials to Manila. Rutledge calls it an unrelated, "unconditional donation" to the district. He also says East Baton Rouge severed its ties to Universal after learning about the teachers' poor treatment. "We in no way want to be complicit in the ill treatment of anybody."
In Northwest Louisiana's Caddo Parish, home to Shreveport public schools, Universal reimbursed the district $8,362 for a June 2008 trip by three officials. It produced 43 teacher hires in hard-to-staff areas, but parish school board members say they didn't know about the trip until two months after it happened.
East Baton Rouge officials defended their arrangement with Universal last year even after a federal agent with the U.S. State Department in Manila wrote to the district with suspicions about the company. And documents in the LFT complaint show that they actually revoked a job offer of a prospective teacher who complained about Universal's fees.
They also apparently didn't balk when Navarro secured not three-year but one-year visas for teachers -- charging each one $1,745 for renewal at the end of the year. The usual fee: $320.
East Baton Rouge spokesman Chris Trahan says the district routinely seeks one-year visas for untenured foreign teachers. "There's no mandate" to get them three-year visas, he says.
Cruz recalls confronting Navarro over the fee, telling her an outside attorney might charge less. She says Navarro shot back, "What if I make an example out of you and sue one of the teachers, just to give you a lesson?"
After that, Cruz says, "everybody got a one-year visa except me -- I got six months."
She eventually got another renewal, but the move had its intended effect. "Everybody was so scared after that," she says.
And since Navarro controlled their visas, Cruz and others believed they couldn't leave the USA or bring their families over. Cruz didn't see her two daughters, ages 7 and 8, for two years. As she speaks about it, her anger dissolves into tears.
Then, on Nov. 2, 2008, a few teachers began posting to a new blog called Pinoy Teachers Hub. ("Pinoy" is an informal term of pride for Filipinos, the equivalent of "Yankee" for a New Englander.) Within days it compiled more than a year's worth of grievances against Navarro.
The blog and both the federal and state complaints also allege that she was a convicted felon -- charges confirmed by legal records, which show that Navarro, 50, admitted defrauding California's Medi-Cal program of more than $1 million in 2000. She also was convicted of money laundering in New Jersey in 2003 and served two years of probation.  That should have raised a red flag had Navarro applied for a Louisiana "employment service" license -- but she never did, the union says.
Teachers say that within two weeks after the blog began, Navarro lowered their rent at the Savoy and cut their visa renewal fee in half.
Easily the most outspoken of the teachers, Cruz says she had nothing to do with the blog.
But Navarro accused Cruz of starting it and sued her for libel in a lawsuit that eventually was dismissed. Navarro has appealed, but it caught the attention of LFT, which began investigating teachers' complaints.
Cruz hopes it stops what she and others call the mistreatment of a new wave of Filipino teachers. "Somebody needs to speak up and tell their story because we can't keep on," she says. "If she was just threatening us over small things and we're done with her in two years, then no problem with that. But lives are being destroyed."
Fernandez writes for The (Shreveport, La.) Times.

Could Facebook swing an election?

Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is no stranger to political involvement. But if companies such as Facebook get involved in politics, will users lose trust and abandon them? And given the possibility of under-the-table hanky-panky, will opponents call for regulation to ensure transparency?
Speaking at Facebook's annual F8 conference last week, Zuckerberg launched into an attack on Republican front-runner Donald Trump's policies. It's not surprising that Zuckerberg, who has been a big fan of H-1B visas that critics say hold wages down for programmers and software engineers hired by companies such as Facebook, doesn't think much of Trump's plan to limit immigration. But so what? Lots of people are for open borders, even people who, unlike Zuckerberg, don't stand to make billions off them.
Somewhat more troubling was  that Facebook employees asked Zuckerberg: "What responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017?"
As Gizmodo's Michael Nunez explains, Facebook uses  undisclosed algorithms to decide what to show us, and it has experimented with manipulating them to affect users' emotional states. Under the First Amendment, Zuckerberg is free to do what he likes here -- though there seems to be something shadier about undercover manipulation of what shows in your timeline as opposed to, say, editorial endorsements, or even slanted coverage, of the sort we're used to in traditional news media.
Even so, the possibility that by using Facebook you're opening yourself up to manipulation by someone for political reasons could give users pause.
The employees' question itself, as law professor Ann Althouse notes, suggests that Facebook has a diversity problem: "There's an unexamined premise that everyone already shares a political position -- Trump shouldn't win -- and that speaks of a lack of political diversity and pressure on dissenters within the organization to keep silent. For another thing, it omits any thought ...  that the highest duty is to the freedom of speech" of Facebook users.
In response,  Facebook has announced that it is neutral:  "We have not and will not use our products in a way that attempts to influence how people vote."
Other tech companies would be wise to emulate it. America's political split is  50-50. Even if most  tech  employees fall on one side,  it's bad for business, and shareholder value, to alienate  the other side.
Not everyone believes Facebook. British commentator Allum Bokhari notes that Facebook has already censored content at the behest of the German government. And Facebook is "already intervening in European politics," Bokhari writes. "Why should we believe they won't do the same in the U.S. election, particularly when Donald Trump threatens Silicon Valley's all-important H-1B migrant visas?"
Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. America trusts big companies less than it used to. The best way to be trusted: Be trustworthy. Zuckerberg, et al., take note.

Silicon valley slams dismantling of daca; Apple, Microsoft vow to help workers facing immigration trouble

Don't mess with DACA.
That was the message from major technology companies who are pressuring lawmakers to take swift action on a legislative fix after the Trump administration said it would jettison an immigration program that allows young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain here.
Apple and Microsoft, two of the companies to come out swinging against the president's decision to dump Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, pledged to shield employees who could face legal troubles or deportation.
Microsoft President Brad Smith urged Congress to move swiftly with legislation to preserve the immigration program, even prioritizing DACA over tax reform.
"We say this even though Microsoft, like many other companies, cares greatly about modernizing the tax system and making it fairer and more competitive," he wrote.
The Trump administration on Tuesday began winding down the Obama-era immigration program that has allowed some 800,000 young people to study and work in the U.S. but invited Congress to address it through legislation within six months.
The sharp rebuke from Silicon Valley reflects the toughening stance toward Trump administration policies as tech companies seek to protect their business interests and preserve their public image as the "Do no evil" wing of corporate America.
A series of clashes over immigration, including the president's executive order banning immigration from Muslim-majority countries, trade and, most recently, Trump's controversial remarks in Charlottesville, Va., have widened the political divide between the White House and Silicon Valley.
Posing the greatest threat to the tech industry is Trump's "Hire American" policy and his administration's growing efforts to curb immigration. Changes to the nation's immigration rules could undercut the employment practices and bottom lines of major tech companies, both through restrictions on legal immigration -- temporary H-1B visas -- and on young people who work in tech through DACA.
"This is just the latest chapter of Silicon Valley feeling that the president is out of touch certainly with their needs here, if not the nation's," said Larry Gerston, professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University.
For Silicon Valley, immigration has been the key to the greatest wealth-creation machine on the planet. Engineers and entrepreneurs from overseas have played a vital role in building and running some of technology's most powerful companies. Tech companies say they rely on that steady stream of skilled talent, frequently on H-1B visas, to build their products and companies and to address an acute shortage of engineers.
"In Silicon Valley, there's this natural affinity for immigrants," Gerston said. "There's also a sense that immigration has provided an immense source of talent, not just the people who have started companies but those on H-1B visas and DREAMers who come out of college to work as programmers and engineers."
DACA is a cause taken up by many who work for major tech companies. It also matters to the vast communities of people around the globe who use these companies' services.
In a blog post Tuesday, Smith said Microsoft would pay for employees' legal counsel and would intervene in court cases.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was "deeply dismayed" by Trump's decision and said his company would work with Congress to "advocate for a legislative solution."
Apple will provide the approximately 250 employees at Apple potentially affected by the termination of DACA with the support they need, including the counsel of immigration experts, he said.
Among the other tech company CEOs speaking out were Google's Sundar Pichai and Box's Aaron Levie.
Tech companies, which used to shy away from Washington, are now some of the most powerful corporate interests there, shaping a range of policies from immigration to privacy to taxes. While the tech industry stands to benefit from looser regulations and tax overhaul embraced by the Trump administration, its opposition to the administration's positions on immigration has escalated.
Following Trump's first immigration order, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote: "I hope we find the courage and compassion to bring people together and make this world a better place for everyone."
That tone has changed dramatically as Silicon Valley finds itself increasingly at odds with Trump.
Zuckerberg said Tuesday the termination of DACA marked a "sad day" for the country and urged Congress to step in.
"The decision to end DACA is not just wrong," Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post. "It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it."

Create jobs by bringing in immigrants; The U.S. should grease the skids to give foreign entrepreneurs (i.e. job creators) access to the American dream of business

Mark your calendars: In about 1,500 days, normal life returns. In around  48 months of mortgage payments and credit card bills, of buying groceries and gas, economic prosperity is scheduled to make a comeback.
An August prediction by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that by the end of 2014, the unemployment rate will finally decrease to 5%, the regular rate in a healthy economy.  While various factors could make that estimate hooey, it remains a reasonable -- and terrifying -- prediction based on the information currently available.
Lingering for four more years in an era where a reality show titled The Fairy Jobmother has a built-in audience should be unacceptable.  With unemployment hovering around the 10% mark for a year-and-a-half now,  8 million jobs lost since the recession's start,  and no immediate prospect of the economy producing the 200,000 jobs a month necessary to launch the country back to economic health,  it's time to fight for any and all jobs.
That's why it's essential that the U.S. attracts and retains international talent. Harnessing the creative brainpower of the best scientists, mathematicians and technology whizzes currently living across the globe could help the nation's economy soar back to prosperity. High-skilled immigrants' ideas and innovations can launch new companies or revitalize established businesses, generating jobs for all.
Expand the visa process
But the current U.S. immigration policy doesn't recognize the potential these new entrepreneurs have for invigorating our stalled economy. Strict caps on the number of immigrants allowed per year, and numerous laws and rules,  legal tape and fees,  ensure that for many would-be immigrants, starting a life in the USA is about as easy as it is for an American to find a non-texting teen. What we need to do is gradually change our immigration policy, beginning with establishing visas targeted at entrepreneurs interested in launching start-up companies.
Currently, a foreign entrepreneur who invests at least $1 million in opening a new U.S. business that will employ 10 or more people receives an EB-5 (or employment-based) visa.  A bill sponsored by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Richard Lugar, R-Ind., would change that. Instead, foreign entrepreneurs with at least $250,000 in financial backing from a U.S. investor and the intention of hiring five or more employees would receive a two-year visa.  Those specific parameters aren't ideal: Critics point out that companies have been launched with an average of $31,000  and that some start-ups initially employ fewer than five workers.   Regardless, it's crucial to make these visas easily accessible.
That's because high-skilled immigrants have a proven record of generating jobs.
From 1995 to 2005, a quarter of start-up technology or engineering companies had at least one immigrant founder. (At the front end of the Internet boom in 1995, Jerry Yang, who was born in Taiwan, co-founded tech giant Yahoo.) Those companies produced 450,000 jobs in the U.S. over the decade, according to a 2007 paper written by Duke University professor Vivek Wadhwa.  To put that number into context, last year's $814 billion stimulus  is estimated by a November White House report  to have created or saved 2.7  million-3.7  million jobs.  High-skilled immigrants might not top that number, but whatever jobs they do create don't cost taxpayers a dime.
And odds are, foreign entrepreneurs could help tens of thousands of Americans re-enter the working world. Entrepreneur and start-up visa promoter Brad Feld figures the visas could create 5,000 to 25,000 jobs annually, while the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), a public policy think tank, estimates that up to 100,000 jobs could be created over three years if 10,000 start-up visas were issued per year.
H-1B 'brain drain'
In addition to start-up visas, the U.S. should make   H-1B visas easier for high-skilled workers to obtain. With these visas requiring filing fees up to $6,000  and allowing workers to stay a maximum of six years,  it's no wonder that the combination of the recent recession and the expanded economic opportunities in many would-be immigrants' home countries has resulted in a sharp decline of those seeking H-1B visas. That trend -- what Wadhwa calls a "brain drain"  --  is unfortunate because it deprives the U.S. of the chance to the reap the economic rewards that the innovations and skills of these talented workers could bring.
Nor does research suggest that H-1B visa holders are snatching jobs that would otherwise go to Americans. A 2008 study from NFAP found that for every immigrant hired by a technology company, five Americans were also hired.  That correlation indicates that there's no need to assume Americans lose when internationals are hired.
As Americans have painfully learned in recent years, there's no guaranteed amount of jobs. The upside to that, however, is there's no limit on how many jobs could be created if there's technology and creativity fueling new inventions and products.
In these dismal times, why wouldn't we want to do some insourcing, harvesting the potential that the world's brightest and most talented could bring to U.S. companies? Ultimately, the best way to restore the American dream to the millions of Americans unemployed or underemployed might just be to open the country and share that dream with immigrants all over the world.

Most tech leaders turn backs on Trump; But a few in Silicon Valley say they support his stance on H-1B visas, immigration

It may be more elusive than a freshly minted Silicon Valley unicorn: a tech executive who openly supports Donald Trump.
Yet they exist, a minority in an industry that's swiftly distanced itself from the Republican presidential candidate, whose views on immigration and trade clash with their own.
These contrarians support Trump's risk-taking, pro-business mien and oppose expanding the H-1B work permit visa program, which allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in STEM fields.
"I like when business people run for president," says John Rampton, CEO of Due, a financial-advice platform for small business owners based in Menlo Park, Calif. He's donated to the Trump campaign because Trump "speaks his mind and doesn't care what people think. That is how you affect change."
It's not the most popular stance in the valley where, Rampton says, "Once a day, I'm asked to F-myself for wearing a 'Make America Great Again' cap."
Silicon Valley has tended to lean Democratic. But even those executives who supported Trump's GOP rivals have shifted their allegiance to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Her campaign has drawn the lion's shares of donations.
Meanwhile, some big tech companies (Apple, HP Inc.) have quietly withdrawn support for Monday's kickoff of the Republican National Convention. Dozens of other founders, executives and entrepreneurs last week slammed Trump as "anti-innovation" and took aim at his rhetoric, which they wrote "traffics in ethnic and racial stereotypes, repeatedly insults women and is openly hostile to immigration."
Intel CEO Brian Krzanich recently  said he canceled a June event for Trump at his Silicon Valley home because it had morphed from a summit on ideas to a fundraiser. "I do not intend to endorse any presidential candidate," the CEO tweeted June 2.
Aside from venture capitalist Peter Thiel, tech is likely to be a no-show in terms of personalities when the Republican National Convention gets underway in Cleveland.
Former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, who sought the GOP nomination this year and later stumped for Trump, is not included on the RNC speakers list. Current Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman has voiced strong opposition to Trump.
This absence reflects a deep displeasure with Trump's campaign-trail comments at a time when Silicon Valley says it's attempting to diversify its workforce behind a composition that's more white and male than other industries -- despite its increasingly multi-ethnic customer base and ambitions around the globe.
Trump further inflamed acrimony with tweets targeting Apple and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. A Trump spokesperson also slammed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
None of this apparently matters to Thiel. The early investor in Facebook is slated to speak in Trump's favor at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The tech mogul aims to have an honest conversation about the country's problems at the convention, he said in a statement to USA TODAY.
"Many people are uncertain in this election year, but most Americans agree that our country is on the wrong track," Thiel said in the statement.
Scott Slinker, CEO of analytics start-up Paradata, has said the presumptive Republican nominee could be more of a fit in Silicon Valley than he gets credit for. Slinker told The New York Times Trump has a lot of ideas and pivots away from them if they don't work, a familiar tactic for start-ups.
"He's more viral than Facebook ever was," Slinker told the newspaper.
Trump's immigration policy,  which includes building a wall with Mexico and has floated a ban on Muslim immigrants, has struck a discordant chord with the tech community on multiple levels.
The industry has many employees born in countries outside the U.S., particularly India, and several of its seminal companies -- Google and Yahoo, to name two -- were co-founded by immigrants.
But the real estate mogul's hard-line immigration views resonate with some business execs.
Jan Soule, president of Silicon Valley Association of Republican Women, objects to H-1B visa workers who, she claims, are hired by tech companies to "replace Americans" who should have the same jobs.
Smaller tech businesses looking to create jobs for U.S. workers could be Trump's largest supporters in technology, said Paolo Tiramani, CEO of intellectual property investment and development company 500 Group, based in Connecticut.
Tiramani said tech titans such as Facebook, Google and Apple are more likely to support candidates who favor H-1B worker visas. Clinton has voiced approval for the policy option in the past.

Trump would upend legal immigration; He proposes slashing entries, favoring well-educated foreigners

In a mere three-minute speech Wednesday at the White House, President Trump proposed a sweeping new U.S. immigration system that would overturn the rules for becoming an American citizen and cut in half the number of people allowed into the country.
His comments marked a radical break from decades of bipartisan consensus on legal immigration, and the reaction was swift and severe, drawing rebukes from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who called the proposal a non-starter. Some worried about the impact on their state economies and others about the nation's tradition as a refuge for immigrants.
The fallout was so great that a White House adviser found himself debating the symbolism of the Statue of Liberty as a beacon of light and welcome for those around the world seeking a better life in the USA, where one in four Americans are first- or second-generation immigrants.
Trump's attacks on illegal immigration have been central to his presidential campaign and his first six months in office, during which he mobilized the Department of Homeland Security to ramp up deportations of undocumented immigrants. Wednesday's announcement marked his first attempt to tackle the legal immigration system.
Taking cues from immigration systems in Canada and Australia, the plan would end the long-held practice of U.S. citizens sponsoring parents, siblings and adult children for permanent residence and ultimate citizenship. Americans would be allowed to bring in only their spouses and minor children, a restriction immigration opponents have sought for years.
Instead, a "merit-based" system would grade foreign applicants on their potential contributions to the economy, and the highest scores -- and entry -- would go to those with advanced education, English proficiency and a stellar work history.
The proposal is part of a bill sponsored by Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia. It would switch from a system based on family members in the USA to one based on economic value to the country.
The bill would slash in half the 1.1 million documented permanent residents admitted to the USA last year and end a diversity program that grants 50,000 long-term visas a year to foreigners from countries that are underrepresented in the USA. Most are reserved for those from Africa, Asia and eastern Europe.
The end result would be a complete reversal of America's immigration priorities. About 63% of those granted permanent residency, or green cards, have family ties. Trump's proposal would flip the system around to resemble Canada's, which grants about 63% of its green cards based on its economic points system.
Trump said the new system would help unemployed Americans who often compete with low-skilled immigrants who will work for low wages. "This legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling American families who deserve an immigration system that puts their needs first and that puts America first," Trump said.
Critics argued that the workers Trump said he's trying to help would be hurt the most by the proposal.
Some members of Congress echoed those economic concerns and lamented what Trump's proposal would mean for the identity of the USA.
"This bill would have us turn our back on America's history as a nation of immigrants and the very thing that makes us both a great power and economically resilient," Democratic Reps. John Conyers of Michigan and Zoe Lofgren of California said in a statement.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Trump's push to focus more on high-skilled immigrants would destroy the low-wage tourism and agricultural businesses in his state.
Trump's focus on high-skilled immigration runs contrary to the actions of his administration.
Shortly after taking office, Trump announced a review of the H-1B visa program, which brings in high-skilled foreign workers trained in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Trump said the program was abused by technology companies as they imported cheaper foreign workers to replace U.S. tech employees.
Two weeks ago, Trump's Department of Homeland Security announced it would create 15,000 additional H-2B visas designed for low-skilled workers, such as those in retail, construction, restaurants, hotels and resorts, including those run by the Trump Organization.
White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said Wednesday the Trump Organization would not stop using low-skilled foreign workers until federal law is changed and all businesses play by the same rules. Until those changes are made, Miller said, Trump's companies would be at a disadvantage.
In the White House briefing room, Miller took a question about what Trump's proposal would mean for the identity of the nation as expressed in Emma Lazarus' poem welcoming the tired, the poor, the "huddled masses yearning to breathe free."
"The poem you're referring to was added later, it's not actually part of the original Statue of Liberty," Miller said.

Give U.S. tech companies access to the best brains

Even at a time of 7.5% unemployment, Microsoft has a few job openings: 6,300 at last count. Most pay well and come with an array of benefits. The catch -- and the reason many positions have remained vacant for years -- is that most are for seriously smart engineers and code writers.
There just aren't enough of those coming out of U.S. universities. So companies such as Microsoft do what they can. One approach is to sponsor foreign job applicants for H-1B visas, a program for highly skilled foreign workers.
But with just 85,000 such visas available annually for the entire country, the pickings are getting very slim. Last year, it took 10 weeks for the cap to be reached. This year, it took five days.
And even for companies that find suitable candidates, the H-1B is far from a perfect solution. The six-year visa gives its holder no special advantage in obtaining a green card for permanent residence.
Aware of the situation that U.S. tech companies face, Canadian Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has taken to showing up at conferences and trade shows trying to cherry-pick the brightest tech wizards with the promise of permanent residency in Canada. His government has even rented billboard space in California with the message: "H-1B problems? Pivot to Canada." Microsoft is among several tech companies that have opened offices in Canada to employ skilled workers they can't get into the United States.
Somewhat belatedly, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to respond to the threat. The comprehensive immigration measure that the Senate Judiciary Committee approved last week would increase the annual number of H-1B visas to at least 110,000 and eventually to as many as 180,000, depending on job market conditions.
Just as important, the bill would provide a direct and immediate route to a green card for holders of master's and Ph.D. degrees from U.S. colleges in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Many brilliant STEM graduates have to take their American educations back home because they're denied access to jobs in the USA.
Efforts to attract and retain the smartest workers should be a matter of little debate. Companies such as Microsoft, Google, Intel and Facebook are among America's biggest economic engines, and they are in a global competition for top talent.
Opponents, led by organized labor, contend that foreign workers displace Americans, but that's hard to square with the huge numbers of unfilled jobs.
It's time to give America's technological leaders the tools they need to compete in a global marketplace. Companies shouldn't have to open offices north of the border, or across an ocean, to fill the jobs they desperately want to fill at home.

The bad boy is no president; But it doesn't matter that Clinton the honor student crushed Trump the class slacker. Debates are personality contests, not the SATs.

There is a familiar character in movies aimed at teenagers. She's a girl -- it's usually a girl -- who comes to school well-scrubbed and with all her homework done and all of her pencils sharpened. She's in a well-pressed dress and when she is called on by the teacher, her responses are crisp and well-rehearsed. But she's also a goody-two-shoes, smugly self-satisfied and not a really cool kid. Way in the back of the room slouched at his desk is the class bad boy in his black leather jacket who makes faces, rolls spitballs, and amuses the kids around him with his wisecracks at the expense of the model student. He's also something of a bully.
So it was at Monday night's presidential debate with Donald Trump, the sullen rebel, picking at the well-pressed pinafore of model student Hillary Clinton.
Like the high-school slacker, Trump was unprepared. Much of what he had to say consisted of tired platitudes about the headlong plunge of America into Third-World mediocrity, foreign countries eating our lunch, parasitic allies leeching off of us. Much of it was recycled from the Republican presidential debates from this spring.
Clinton, by contrast, proved once again that she's the smartest kid in the class but probably not the most likable.
In the debate, the honor roll student beat the pants off the class wiseguy, and the senior class yearbook will reflect that. But she probably didn't win the support of the kids who prefer cheeky iconoclasm to scrupulous preparation and polished presentation.
For alienated, discontented Americans -- the 60-year-old software engineer ticked off about having been pushed aside by a technology-savvy H-1B visa holder, or a factory worker sidelined by low-priced labor from Mexico -- Clinton had little to offer.
Trump, as he had done so effectively in the primaries, channeled the frustrations such people endure by expressing them in an idiom that is neither elegant nor refined nor even well-informed. But he sounds a lot like they'd sound if given the opportunity to stand on a national stage.
Trump's insolence and self-aggrandizing puffery, his pouting and posturing, are a small price to pay for the satisfaction of having someone who "tells it like it is."
Clinton will probably get a modest bump in the polls for her solid and well-informed performance, but the debate was a personality test more than it was an SAT. She needed to descend from the loftiness of the honor society and mix more freely with the kids in the lunch room. She missed an opportunity to do that. She still has two debates to make her case, but she'll never win over the kids in the detention hall, and she probably would be wasting her time trying.
The polls will continue to be close, and waiting around for a knockout blow to be delivered will not be a good use of our time. The messages of the candidates will be largely unchanged from now until Nov. 8 and for all of their value as political spectacles, the presidential debates of 2016 will be no more decisive in the outcome than any of the others we've had since 1960.
Polarization has so cemented in place the political loyalties of Americans that even those Republicans who rejected Trump this spring have concluded that they have discovered the appeal of the kid who never turns in his homework on time.

Do high-tech firms really need imported workers? Yes

As the new economy cruises along, technology companies say they
need more qualified workers to keep the momentum going. A severe
shortage, they say, is getting worse because many skilled workers
allowed in six years ago on temporary H-1B visas are now being
pushed out. They want Congress to extend the program and raise
the number of workers allowed to about 200,000, before it adjourns
next month. But critics say these firms simply want cheaper labor.
Two views:

It's easy to feel comfortable, with the country enjoying the longest
period of economic growth in its history. Easy, too, to feel good
about the contributions of the high-tech industry, where I make
my living. After all, America's record-setting run -- the incredible
job growth and productivity gains -- dates back to 1995, just
when the Internet was starting to hit its stride.
That's why I'm worried. It would be all too easy to screw this
up.
America is clearly in the lead when it comes to high-tech prowess
and inventiveness, but that lead has not been bestowed upon us
as a birthright. We have to continue to earn it every day by moving
faster, dreaming bigger and working harder than the competition.
This is where the casual observer might ask, "So what's stopping
you? Go do your job."
One small problem: We need more qualified workers. A lot more.
And right away. We need people who dream in bits and bytes, people
who have a gift for computer code and circuits.
Unfortunately, there just aren't enough of them in this country
right now.
The shortage is dramatic: Hundreds of thousands of highly skilled
jobs are going unfilled. The time to address this critical problem
is now.
The first order of business is for Congress to pass responsible
legislation to raise the cap on H-1B visas for qualified foreign
workers. These temporary visas allow highly skilled foreign nationals
to work in this country for up to six years.
What makes the shortage even worse is that we soon will be losing
valuable employees by the tens of thousands, as their temporary
visas expire and their green-card applications languish in enormous
processing backlogs.
In essence, we will be deporting valuable workers at a time when
our growing economy needs them most. As Congress winds down toward
adjournment, a stalemate would do no one any good.
People these days talk about "Internet time" -- a reference
to the dizzying pace of innovation and growth in the high-tech
sector. But this astounding rate of technological development
is no accident. It is being driven by global competition, which
is both relentless and ferocious.
It makes no sense to educate and train foreign students in American
universities, only to wind up sending those valuable individuals
back overseas to compete against us.
Truth be told, the contributions of skilled workers born outside
the United States help us create a growing number of high-paying
jobs for Americans. That's especially apparent at Sun Microsystems,
because two of its co-founders, Andy Bechtolsheim and Vinod Khosla,
were foreign nationals.
Another great example: James Gosling, a Canadian national, developed
one of our best-known technologies, the Java platform, which has
revolutionized software development.
Do we really want to turn away the next Bechtolsheim, the next
Khosla, the next Gosling -- and with them the many jobs and technical
advances their work generates?
That's exactly what is happening today -- and has been happening
since March 21, when we reached the current annual cap on H-1B
visas.
The long-term strategy is, of course, providing better education
and training for the U.S. workforce. Indeed, industry already
is spending billions on education at all levels, investing in
a generation of workers whose training will take years.
In the meantime, we have a large and growing gap to fill and only
one way to fill it: expand the H-1B visa program.
Time is critical. Congress and the White House need to get this
done before the end of the congressional session next month.
While we are stuck in neutral, our global competitors will be
charging ahead.
My company, for one, will continue stretching the bounds of what
is possible -- using technology to improve the way people do business,
communicate with one another and run their lives.
This work is going to be done. The only question is where.

Trump offers few details on tech policies; President-elect has attacked various sectors of industry

In his improbable race to the presidency, President-elect Donald Trump treated tech as he did much of the electorate.
He trash-talked it in tweets, offering few insights on a $2.9 trillion  industry that's been in overdrive, but for which he has no discernible policy.
In 140 characters or less, he called for a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino (Calif.) shooters. He chided Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos because, he claimed, Amazon didn't pay "fair taxes." And Trump has urged Apple and others to make hardware in the U.S. instead of China to  make "America first."
But Trump has outlined  policies on trade, tax reform, immigration and jobs that could  reverberate through industry and its investors. His hard-line stance against mergers, in particular AT&T-Time Warner, could also weaken  thirst for M&A and IPOs.
"We will see far less IPOs and exits in the short term as big tech companies and VCs wait and see what kind of president Trump will be," says Ben Parr, co-founder of Octane AI, a bot-creation  start-up in San Francisco.
Trump has espoused tighter immigration and  boosting American workers, possibly putting a dent in the hiring plans of tech start-ups and  dissuading foreign entrepreneurs from establishing operations in the U.S.
The H-1B program, a non-immigrant visa program that lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialized jobs, is "threatened," says Mark Goines, vice chairman of Personal Capital, an online financial-advisory firm based in San Francisco.
"If we want to keep jobs here, then we have to train engineers here," Goines says. "Trump doesn't want to impose more programs, so re-training people to become tech workers is critical to restructuring employment in America. It's not clear if you change the core rules of H-1B that it will actually benefit the American workforce."
It is a sensitive topic in tech, where 51% of billion-dollar start-ups in the U.S. were founded by immigrants and 70% of their key hires are from outside the country, according to a non-partisan study on entrepreneurship from the National Foundation for American Policy.
Trump's repeated promise to declare China a manipulator of currency could lead to tariffs of 45% on Chinese imports and 35% on products from Mexico, though some economists expect more modest tariffs.

As the new economy cruises along, technology companies say they

shortage, they say, is getting worse because many skilled workers
allowed in six years ago on temporary H-1B visas are now being
pushed out. They want Congress to extend the program and raise
the number of workers allowed to about 200,000, before it adjourns
next month. But critics say these firms simply want cheaper labor.
Two views:
<>
In recent years, news reports across the country have cited studies
that claim there is a huge shortage of workers in the technology
industry. These claims have been repeated so often that they have
become "fact" to many people.
What the public does not realize is that, in most cases, the groups
putting out these studies are the same ones who are lobbying to
allow more foreign workers into the country. These groups contend
that if they can't import more foreign programmers, the new economy
may collapse.
Let's not be too hasty. Congress' General Accounting Office (GAO),
which recently analyzed various studies that estimated shortages
between 700,000 and 190,000, concluded that "more information
is needed to characterize the (information technology) labor market
and determine the extent of any shortage."
If the shortage is suspect, what do these employers really want?
They want cheap programmers from other countries. I'll start believing
there is a shortage when programmer salaries start rising half
as fast as CEO salaries, or when I see half as many African-Americans
at work as H-1B workers.
Recently, I responded to two dozen job postings on the Web. Only
one company got back to me, but said I was "overqualified."
That kind of response does not suggest a desperate programmer
shortage.
What should outrage Americans is the industry's solution to its
mythical labor shortage: the H-1B visa program. These visas allow
employers to import temporary workers in "specialty occupations"
for up to six years. That sounds innocent enough, but the details
should concern you. The law, for example, contains a loophole
that allows employers to fire hard-working Americans and replace
them with foreign workers.
I learned of the H-1B program after cleaning up the widely reported
mess at American International Group (AIG), a company that fired
its programming staff and replaced it with foreign workers. By
using lower-paid H-1B workers, AIG expected to save millions of
dollars a year. But the foreign programmers were incompetent,
so the firm saved nothing.
What it did is perfectly legal. Supporters tell us H-1B can't
be used for cheap labor because H-1B workers have to be paid the
prevailing wage. They neglect to mention that the employer determines
the prevailing wage. The government, as GAO reported, can "initiate
investigations to address potential (abuse) only if narrowly restricted
circumstances are met."
When you have a system designed to be abused with impunity, it
generates high demand. H-1B was originally limited to 65,000 visas
a year, but was raised to 115,000 in 1998. Now lobbyists are demanding
this be increased to 200,000.
H-1B is simply a welfare program for wealthy campaign contributors
that should be ended. But despite the audits documenting abuse,
calls from government officials to clean things up and the opposition
of 84% of Americans to the program, Congress has refused to do
anything but grovel for cash. As Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va., noted,
"This (H-1B) is a very important issue for the high-tech executives
who give the money."
Americans need to realize the depth to which money has corrupted
Congress, and act accordingly at the ballot box Nov. 7. They also
should lobby members of Congress to vote against the H-1B visa
legislation.

books and chairman of the Programmers Guild, an organization that

2016 was a tech year like no other; From self-driving cars to botnets, a look back and ahead

The image was startling but a look into what could be tech's  future.
After being ostracized by the  industry for most of the election year, there sat venture capitalist Peter Thiel, beaming, to the left of President-elect Donald Trump at the Trump Tower Tech summit in mid-December.
Around him was a ring of glum-faced and pensive tech titans, including Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet's Larry Page and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg.
Silicon Valley's billionaire leaders had disavowed Trump during the campaign, throwing their weight behind  Hillary Clinton. Only Thiel stumped for Trump, and after the tech industry had turned on him for that and his role in Gawker's failure, he was luxuriating in the I-told-you-so moment.
The display of power portends a roiling year or two in tech. Trump railed against Amazon and Apple in tweets about corporate taxes and cyber security; now he's likely to shape those issues as well as immigration reform, job creation, trade with China, deregulation and more as he vowed during a bruising campaign.
"Tech is unusual in that the industry does not depend on government regulation or transfer payments the way that banking, pharma, defense, agriculture and energy do," says Roger McNamee, founding partner of venture-capital firm Elevation Partners. "All tech needs is policy stability and access to global markets. Trump prides himself on being unpredictable."
It was a topsy-turvy year for tech, which generated $3.5 trillion in domestic economic output and accounted for more than 15 million people, or 8.4% of total U.S. employment, according to the Computer Technology Association. There were winners and losers among companies and technologies; new faces emerged while others faded; and driverless cars and drones became more visible in our streets and sky.
High-profile meltdowns
Whether computer breaches that compromised the personal information of millions of consumers to a targeted hack by Russian operatives that conceivably tilted the U.S. presidential election, the very nature of conflict transformed this year, McNamee says.
And with the advent of the Internet of Things, the battlefield could extend to our homes, security experts warn.
Samsung's stumble with the self-igniting Galaxy Note 7 was an epic meltdown of quality control, distribution and marketing. Though it didn't dislodge the South Korean electronics giant as the pre-eminent smartphone seller globally, it undercut  trust.
Yahoo disclosed it had been the victim of two megahacks that compromised more than 1.5 billion accounts and jeopardized its $4.8 billion deal with Verizon.
Our friends, the bots
Artificial intelligence is officially a craze -- Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft are among those with aggressive plans. Virtual reality became more of a reality. Drones are popping up in all shapes and sizes.
Self-driving cars took to the streets in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and California. Fully autonomous cars won't be available for a few years, but a Morgan Stanley study estimates they will lead to productivity gains of $507 billion annually as consumers spend less time commuting and more time in meetings, writing reports and other business tasks.
Bots were ubiquitous, especially in the spread of fake news.
There was nothing fake, however, over fears on what AI and increased automation will do to the workforce. This is sure to draw the attention of Trump, who lambasted Apple for exporting jobs overseas and discussed jobs creation at the  tech summit.
The Trump effect
His focus on immigration reform will undoubtedly pinch H-1B visas and heighten the urgency for increased STEM education. What is unclear is how it might play into tech's stuttering attempts to become less homogenous by hiring more of the women and minorities who buy its products but have little role in their design.
There are 500,000 computing jobs open in the U.S., with an expected 20% growth rate over the next decade -- yet only 55,000 bachelor degrees in computer science were doled out in 2014, according to Code.org and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"It's more important than ever," says Dennis Yang, CEO of Udemy, an online learning marketplace with more than 14 million students in 190 countries.
Tech's impasse with the Trump administration over job creation seems inevitable, but there may be hope. In his meeting with the reluctant CEOs, Trump vowed to keep the channels of communication open and meet quarterly.

No long-term workers' paradise

My friends are all on the job market. They haven't put themselves
there. Headhunters call them all day, promising exciting opportunities
with "multibillion-dollar firms" or "dynamic start-ups."
Poaching, they learn, causes the vacancies. The Goliaths lose
talent when managers strike out on their own or join hotter companies.
And the start-ups, since the beginning of this summer anyway,
are losing top talent as some new hires paddle back to their old,
big, safer employers.
It doesn't make sense that both trends coincide -- but then again,
little about our full-employment job market makes sense to those
of us used to painstakingly crafting our resumes,
endlessly networking and weaseling our way into the workplace
with low-paid internships.
When I graduated from college 20 years ago, job-search counselors
offered cloak-and-dagger strategies for getting employers on the
phone. (Remember the "informational interview"?) Now the strategies
offered recent grads are on how to negotiate for cellphones, cars,
vacation and rich stock packages.
To listen to employers, the current state of affairs doesn't bother
them much. In the new economy, they allow, it pays to give workers
bigger stakes. They work harder and are more committed to the
enterprise.
Bunk!
Don't expect this inversion of power to last. Employers don't
like to go begging. They like inflated compensation packages even
less.
Every market imbalance finds ways to correct itself. When this
one corrects, the workers' paradise will turn back to business
as usual.
Companies, in fact, already are finding ways to tilt the balance
of power back in their favor. Some of the very workplace practices
designed to attract workers and keep them productive also can
work to strengthen a company's hand.
In the new economy, for example, teamwork is touted as a way to
empower workers. In teams, they make their decisions independent
of higher management. In teams, the knowledge of one worker spreads
quickly. Thus, as teams get stronger, individual workers have
a harder time making a mark for themselves. Teamwork is one of
the hallmarks of the much-touted "flat organization." In it,
all workers supposedly have easy access to all others. Bosses'
doors stay open; team members on Project A can waltz into Project
B and ask all the questions they want.
But flat organizations can give employers added power. Workers
routinely are asked to enter every detail about their work affairs
-- their discoveries, their contacts, their ideas, their general
knowledge -- into electronic databases. That creates near-replicants
to stay behind when talented workers leave. It also helps ensure
that no one can identify himself as a core employee when he looks
for other work. Amorphous duties and accomplishments can make
it hard to shine in a job search.
Employers also are learning stealth ways to pinch workers. An
April survey by the Society for Human Resource Management found
that reductions in certain benefits, such as vacation and health
programs, may be cutting back on workers' overall take.
Where downsizing was once a response to too many workers, it now
is a response to too few. Corporate mergers still aim at reducing
"redundant workers." Look at any big combination in recent years
-- Citicorp and Travelers, Union Pacific and Southern Pacific
Rail, Bell Atlantic and GTE -- and worker reductions always are
part of the package. According to John Challenger of Challenger,
Grey and Christmas, a national outplacement firm, some companies
are closing or consolidating some factories rather than giving
in to the tight labor market. Dana Corp., an auto parts company,
folded a Michigan plant into operations in Texas. Omaha, already
hit hard by the job cuts at Union Pacific, lost thousands of high-paying
jobs when five major employers, including Aquila Energy Corp.,
moved operations out of town. Unemployment is still a low 2.8%
in Omaha, but some of its most skilled workers now must relocate
to find jobs at their old pay scales. Without their old employers,
their local bargaining power is shot.
While some companies shutter plants to move out of tight labor
markets, others are shifting to importing cheaper workers. Currently,
there are about 420,000 foreign workers holding technical jobs
in the United States. These workers are tied to their workplaces
not by the promise of stock options, but by a temporary, H-1B
work visa that gives them virtually no options in the American
workplace. Their employers have the ultimate comfort of knowing
that their workers can't go anywhere else but home.
A recent Georgetown study shows the cost of that enforced status:
Foreigners make less than their American counterparts in like
jobs. With a push from corporate employers, Congress is considering
expanding the number of workers who can come in on temporary visas.
That, employers hope, will solve their problems with demanding
American workers.
The effort faces serious challenges from American civil rights
and labor groups and a consortium of black colleges. Their argument:
Industry could do more to train Americans who are still left out
of the high-tech job boom. But that, of course, could cost more
money.
The objectors have a point. Give the job market time, and eventually
it can stir up a supply of American workers to meet the demand.
This year, Silicon Valley companies alone are trying to fill more
than 100,000 jobs. Read the ads in tech industry publications,
and it is clear that companies are working just as hard to brand
themselves as enlightened employers as they are to brand themselves
to potential customers.
Yet the rhetoric of the new workplace breaks down as soon as employers
can break it. Last winter, 18,000 Boeing technical workers, including
engineers, found themselves in a bitter strike. Who were those
workers? By appearances, the sort that tech employers routinely
say it pays to share equity and decision-making with, the kind
it pays to nurture with on-the-job training and in-office coffee
bars. Yet Boeing's capable techies didn't make anything close
to Silicon Valley-size salaries. Many were paid $ 50,000 or less.
Management often shut the rank and file out of decision-making
and was stingy with benefits.
The reason: It could. There is no competition for aerospace workers,
and management could, and did, squeeze them.
Boeing isn't an isolated case. Verizon, a leader in the hottest
tech niche, telecommunications, recently found itself in similar
straits. Nearly 90,000 of its workers went on strike. One of their
chief beefs: The company had used the tight labor market as an
excuse to force workers to put in long hours of mandatory overtime
without prior notice (up to 15 extra hours a week) and, thus,
kept them from their families. Only by striking could workers
extract the benefits other new-economy employers now, purportedly,
provide willingly: profit sharing, outlets from stress on the
job and an affordable medical plan.
The old economy gave way to the new one. Lately, however, it looks
like the new is re-creating the past.

Issa bill aims to overhaul H-1B immigration program
USA TODAY
January 6, 2017 Friday

Congressman Darrell Issa on Wednesday re-introduced legislation to change eligibility requirements for H-1B visa exemptions and limit the outsourcing of jobs.
The Protect and Grow American Jobs Act, co-authored by Issa, R-Calif., and U.S. Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., addresses what's sure to be a hot-button issue this year amid repeated vows by President-elect Donald Trump to overhaul immigration laws. But it faced opposition last year in Congress and could encounter more resistance this time around.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who has worked on immigration overhaul for more than a decade and frequently discussed the topic with Issa, says the bill would hurt Silicon Valley -- which includes her district -- and plans to introduce legislation of her own.
Welcome to the tech political climate in the Trump Era.
Reshaping immigration is a central tenet of Trump's push for companies, in particular tech, to invest and hire more in the U.S. He has directed his wrath at Apple for its vast offshore operations in China and Ireland, underscoring his frayed relationship with the tech community.
Issa's legislation "will ensure that our valuable high-skilled immigration spots are used by companies when the positions cannot be filled by the existing workforce," Issa said in a statement. It was inspired after Disney, Southern California Edison and other companies came under fire for skirting the visa program to replace American workers with less-expensive foreign workers from overseas, a spokesman for Issa said.
In essence, the bill is intended to close a loophole in the nation's high-skilled immigration system being used by some companies to import cheaper foreign labor, its proponents say. It would raise the salary requirement for the positions to $100,000 a year, up from $60,000, and eliminate the master's degree exemption.
But Lofgren says the bill "doesn't do anything" to stop outsourcing and will prompt companies that abuse the program to concentrate in higher-paying areas where $100,000 would still undercut American wages. (The median income in Silicon Valley is $115,000, she says, with engineers commanding more than $140,000 for starting pay.)
She says: "It is clear (Issa) is feeling the heat to do something with outsourcing a major issue in his district," which comprises northern portions of San Diego County and southern Orange County.

Tech firms soon may hire 80,000 more foreigners

Technology companies on Wednesday applauded Congress' passage
of a bill that will allow 80,000 additional skilled foreign workers
into the USA each year.
The legislation, which President Clinton says he will sign into
law, is designed to help ease the country's shortage of high-tech
workers. Nearly half the 1.6 million information technology jobs
available in the USA this year will go unfilled, says the Information
Technology Association of America.
The measure increases to 195,000 from 115,000 the number of specialty
workers allowed to enter the USA on a temporary visa over each
of the next three years. "Yahoo!" says Bruce Hahn, director
of public policy for the Computing Technology Industry Association.
"We need -- in order to remain competitive -- to get the best
and the brightest, wherever they are."
Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, America Online and
Hewlett-Packard are among the companies that supported raising
the cap on H-1B visas. The bill will "allow the industry to continue
to compete across the world," says Microsoft's Rick Miller. The
software giant has had 3,500 technical openings in the past 12
months and struggled to fill them, he adds.
Some domestic trade organizations opposed the bill, fearing that
the influx of foreign workers will take jobs away from Americans.
"I don't think people are going to respond very well if native
workers get laid off," says Paul Kostek, a spokesman for the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
But companies surveyed by USA TODAY overwhelmingly support the
bill. "These people are critical," says Dan Larson, director
of media relations for Texas Instruments.
The majority of foreign workers under the existing program come
from India. More than half go into "computer-related occupations"
in the USA, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Analysts say the worker shortage will remain until more Americans
graduate with advanced degrees in science and technology. "It's
a skills gap, not a body shortage," says Barbara Gomolski, research
director at consulting firm Gartner.

Tech workers fear Trump's travel ban; Protesters claim now isn't the time 'to be shy and reserved'

When Mahboud Zabetian got word that a presidential ban on immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries had gone into effect this past weekend, his reaction was immediate.
"We're on a slippery slope," warns Zabetian, a senior software engineer at YouTube who is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He came to this country in 1983 as a 16-year-old Iranian refugee seeking political asylum.
"We need to stop this (travel ban) before it escalates," he says. "We're not far from talk of internment camps, I fear. It's not a time to be shy and reserved."
Protesters in countless U.S. cities agreed, staging demonstrations that continued Monday. Recently, Trump administration officials said the ban would be amended to not impact those holding green cards from the affected countries.
That concession did nothing to allay the fears of another foreign-born engineer.
For the first time, the U.S. "is not home anymore," Ali Khodaei said in a LinkedIn post, commenting on a travel restriction on countries that include Iran. "I felt scared, I felt confused, I felt lonely. My friends and family are scared and helpless."
Khodaei, an Iranian American who has worked as an engineer and scientist at Microsoft and is now senior product manager at LinkedIn, could not be reached for further comment.
But others took to the Internet to express their frustration and fear.
"I believe that with this executive order (on immigration), our president has reverted to the short game," Dara Khosrowshahi, an Iranian refugee who is CEO of online travel service Expedia, told employees in an internal email first reported by GeekWire.
"The U.S. may be  ever-so-slightly less dangerous as a place to live, but it will certainly be seen as a smaller nation, one that is inward-looking vs. forward thinking, reactionary vs. visionary," he said.
The concerns of Zabetian, Khodaei and Khosrowshahi and others deepened Monday, with a Bloomberg report that the Trump administration is preparing an executive order that would take a sledgehammer to work-visa programs that supply tech companies with tens of thousands of workers annually.
The expected order -- which would require companies to hire Americans first -- could force Apple, Amazon, Google and other tech companies to overhaul how they recruit skilled labor. Tech giants have leaned on the H-1B program, they say, because of a shortage of highly-skilled workers in the U.S.
To disrupt a key element of the recruitment process would "create a similar chaos to the travel ban" for tech as well as universities, hospitals and biotech, says immigration lawyer Sam Adair. Applications for such visas this year begin April 1.
In his daily briefing with reporters, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Monday said an action on H-1B is "part of a larger immigration effort."
A fractured relationship
The summit that then-President-elect Donald Trump hosted last month with a dozen tech executives seems like a distant memory.
Trump deemed it a productive meeting but the travel ban prompted overt condemnation from tech executives at Google, Apple, Microsoft, Airbnb and more. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who is Russian, was at a protest at San Francisco International Airport Saturday night.
LinkedIn said it was hastening previous plans to expand its refugee program to include refugees already residing in the U.S. And Box CEO Aaron Levie is helping organize an "anti"-immigration-ban project.
The reaction for many is particularly visceral in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the tech industry is front and center, a large slice of the region's workforce is foreign-born and company founders were immigrants or the children of them -- Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant.
On Sunday, LinkedIn said it was hastening previous plans to expand its refugee program to include refugees already residing in the United States.
The possible overhaul of H-1B visas should elicit another wave of protests. "Immigrants have built some of the crown jewels of Silicon Valley, and alienating immigrants will not serve our country positively," says Raj Mamodia, an Indian immigrant who is CEO at data-analytics firm Brillio.
The human toll of Trump's controversial order was outlined in an email sent to Stanford University administrators obtained by USA TODAY: A graduate student at the university, returning from a research trip to Sudan, was detained for several hours Saturday and handcuffed briefly at JFK International Airport.
Clemson University graduate Nazanin Zinouri said she was detained at Dubai International Airport after visiting family in Tehran, only to be asked by TSA agents to deplane a Washington, D.C.-bound flight.
'I got deported'
"Yes after almost 7 years of living (in) the United States, I got deported," Zinouri said on Facebook.
The fear is real, says Venky Ganesan, managing director of Menlo Ventures, a venture-capital firm in Silicon Valley. The accumulation of a travel ban and potential executive order on work visas undercuts the $3.5 trillion tech industry that employs more than 15 million in the U.S., or 8.4% of total U.S. employment. "This country's best days are about arms wide open" to immigrants, she says.
LinkedIn product manager Khodaei is still holding out hope that the country and the citizens that welcomed him many years ago will help once again in a time of need.
"In the last 12 years, I saw nothing but kindness, and class from people of this country," Khodaei wrote in his post. "I am asking my non-Iranian friends to stand with us. We need to know that you still want us in this country. I refuse to believe that Americans are in favor of this law, and I refuse to believe they want my friends and family out of this country."

Ads' use of sprawl grabs attention
USA TODAY

Over a picture of a mist-shrouded forest, the words jump out in
large type: "10 Virgin Acres. A freshwater stream. Dozens of
old-growth trees. What a great place to build a parking lot for
the new high-rise."
It's quite an attention-getter in this anti-sprawl era, when poll
after poll shows that voters worry about overdevelopment, congestion,
poor air quality and the loss of open space.
But it's the message under the picture that brings a new twist
to the sprawl debate: "And for the most part, it's happening
because of mass immigration."
The controversial $ 1 million ad campaign by four groups that want
to limit immigration claims immigration contributes to sprawl.
Linking sprawl to anything these days gets people to take notice.
Once mostly a local issue, sprawl now plays a key role in some
congressional races. It's also at the center of a national debate
over federal policies that encourage sprawl.
"Immigration is a back-burner issue," says David Ray, spokesman
for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), one
group behind the campaign. "What the ads do is connect immigration
with front-burner issues that affect people on a daily basis."
They do it so well that anti-sprawl advocates worry that some
people will believe the message.
"The public is so frustrated by traffic congestion and urban
sprawl that they're looking for people to blame," says Don Chen,
director of Smart Growth America, a coalition of non-profit groups.
Its 50 members include the Sierra Club, the National Trust for
Historic Preservation, the Natural Resources Defense Council and
the Congress for New Urbanism.
FAIR says immigration means more people and more people means
sprawl. The U.S. population grew by 2.4 million to 273 million
last year. About 35% of the growth was due to immigration, according
to Census Bureau data. FAIR says that when the children of immigrants
are taken into account, immigration makes up 60% of annual growth.
Anti-sprawl groups say most research shows that sprawl happens
even where the population isn't growing. In more than 50 metropolitan
areas that lost people or grew by less than 1% in the 1990s, there
was a large increase in land that was developed, Chen says.
Most managed-growth proponents have steered clear of taking a
position on immigration because the issue is politically charged.
Two years ago, some Sierra Club members pushed for the organization
to call for limits on immigration. The measure was defeated by
60% of the membership. The Sierra Club now is officially neutral
on the immigration issue.
The ad campaign "will hurt the anti-sprawl effort more than it
will help anti-immigrant groups," says Frank Sharry, executive
director of the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy
group in Washington, D.C.
Jonathan Weiss, director of George Washington University's Center
on Sustainability and Regional Growth, says he knows of no definitive
research on immigration's impact on sprawl.
Immigrants traditionally cluster in central cities and close-in
suburbs. But there are indications that they're settling farther
out, largely because of the demand for skilled workers in the
high-tech industry, Weiss says.
FAIR and other groups have lobbied to block an increase in the
number of H-1B visas, which allow foreign professionals to work
in the USA. But Tuesday, the Senate approved, 96-1, a bill that
would raise the annual cap for the visas to 195,000 in each of
the next three years. In recent years, the cap has ranged from
65,000 to 115,000 a year.
"The use of land is determined by housing demand, and immigrants
are part of the overall mix," says Daniel Stein, FAIR's executive
director. "We're going to have a parking lot from sea to shining
sea."
Some of the ads don't mention immigration directly, but the message
is clear. FAIR ads airing now target one of the nation's fastest-growing
counties: Loudoun, a suburb on the outer edge of the Washington,
D.C., metro area, which grew 81% to 156,284 from 1990 to 1999,
according to the Census.
Calling gridlock "One of Loudoun County's Most Popular Pastimes,"
the ad states that nobody seems to know what to do to solve traffic
problems, but, "We can help."
Loudoun County's board of supervisors, dominated by "smart-growth"
proponents, sent a letter this week to FAIR asking it to stop
the campaign immediately. Board Chairman Scott York calls the
ads "offensive, xenophobic and misleading." He says Loudoun
County's growth "is clearly not due to immigration."
FAIR officials say they won't pull the ads, which are scheduled
to run through the end of this week. They will use them as a model
for other ads FAIR plans to run elsewhere. Officials say the message
will work anywhere because every metro area has its own version
of Loudoun County.
"Voters agree with us," Stein says. Since the ad campaign began,
about 90% of the calls to FAIR have been favorable, he says.
Ads that FAIR ran before the primaries in Iowa and South Carolina
are even more direct in blaming immigration for many of the ills
of suburban sprawl.
"The government has allowed the immigration rate to increase
to 1 million a year, five times what we've had historically,"
says one ad that ran in Iowa. "And frankly, there's just not
enough room for them in many of our urban areas. Where will they
go? To places like Iowa. And Iowa will never be the same again."
In an attempt to offset the exodus of residents during the farm
crisis of the 1980s, Iowa recently launched an aggressive campaign
to lure people to the state. A major part of the effort: recruiting
immigrants.

Tech firms gather on immigration challenge; Google, Netflix, Airbnb to meet; Amazon, Microsoft support Washington AG in suit

Tech companies up and down the West coast scrambled Tuesday to figure out what role they could play in opposing President Trump's executive order on immigration, which is having an outsized effect on the industry because of the large number of immigrants and H-1B visa holders it employs.
A loose coalition of California-based tech companies were scheduled to confab Tuesday evening in San Francisco to discuss what actions they might collectively take to fight the executive order, two sources familiar with the meeting, but who weren't authorized to speak publicly about it, told USA TODAY.
Friday's executive order blocks the arrival of  travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries for at least 90 days, including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Syrians are barred indefinitely.
Trump's order immediately blocked the arrival of citizens of the seven countries for at least 90 days. The Syria suspension is indefinite.
Google, Airbnb and Netflix are among the companies planning to meet, they said.
In the Seattle area, Microsoft and Amazon were helping the state's attorney general with Washington's own suit against the immigration order.
The San Francisco meeting was called after lawyers for tech companies began calling and emailing each other over the weekend. The meeting was originally planned to take place at the San Francisco offices of GitHub, which makes software development tools. However, on Tuesday it was moved to an undisclosed location because news of the meeting was leaked. Neither the location nor the time of Tuesday's meeting has been released.
Discussions are still in the very earliest of stages, and it's unclear whether an amicus brief might be filed or if it were, in what jurisdiction, or even if an amicus brief is the appropriate response, sources familiar with some of the discussions said.
Silicon Valley tech firms have come out strongly against the order.
"Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do," CEO Tim Cook said in a memo to employees criticizing the presidential order.
Silicon Valley's relationship with Trump is already rocky, going back to last year's presidential campaign, when many leaders voiced support for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. But it could grow more hostile if Trump follows through with a draft executive order aimed at overhauling the H-1B work-visa program tech companies favor.
The San Francisco meeting comes a day after Washington state Attorney Gneral Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit in federal court to declare key provisions of the executive order unconstitutional.
Three of the state's largest tech companies -- Amazon, Microsoft and Expedia -- all worked with the attorney general's office to collect data on the potential effects of the executive order on their employees and businesses to strengthen the case, Ferguson's office said.
Microsoft, the oldest and largest of the three, provided information to the attorney general and is willing to testify further if necessary.
At least 76 Microsoft employees are affected by the immigration restrictions, Microsoft President Brad Smith said Saturday.
In its declaration, Amazon said it employed 40,000 people in Washington state and at least 49 employees were born in one of the countries covered by the executive order.
Expedia, an online travel company, said in its declaration at least 1,000 Expedia customers who hold passports issued by one of the seven countries listed in the executive order have purchased airline tickets that go through the U.S. and would be potentially impacted.

Once-high demand for visas for tech workers slides Congress passed law raising limit on H-1B visas just 6 months ago

Technology firms, who fought hard last year for the right to hire
more foreign workers, now aren't requesting as many of the coveted
visas as expected, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
said Tuesday.
The slowdown, which some attribute to the economic downturn, could
revive debate about whether the additional visas are warranted.
"There is an overall lack of demand and complete non-justification
for the increase," says Dan Stein, executive director for the
Federation for American Immigration Reform.
Just 6 months ago, Congress passed a law that allowed U.S. companies
to request 195,000 so-called H-1B visas for the 2001 fiscal year,
starting in October. That was up from 115,000 in the 2000 fiscal
year.
Technology companies, who employ many software engineers, championed
the cause because the need for high-tech workers was so great.
But in February, the latest month for which statistics are available,
U.S. companies applied for just 16,000 H-1B visas, down from 32,000
a year ago.
Technology firms insist they still need the higher visa limits.
Intel, for one, continues to hunt for engineers despite the fact
that it is paring 5,000 jobs. "The downturn does not reduce the
demand for highly skilled technical folks in Silicon Valley,"
says Tracy Koon, spokeswoman for the No. 1 chipmaker.
By year's end, companies say they expect to reach the 195,000
cap. And with unemployment below 2% in Santa Clara County, the
heart of Silicon Valley, there will always be "high demand for
highly skilled engineers," says spokeswoman Laura Ipsen of Cisco
Systems, which is trimming up to 5,000 jobs.
But unions and various trade organizations fought the increase
because they say H-1B visa workers take jobs from Americans. They
also claim companies like to hire foreign workers because they
pay them less.
So far this fiscal year, 72,000 H-1B visa applications have been
approved. That's about equal to the number approved during the
same period last year.
The number of applications soared to 53,000 in December. INS spokeswoman
Eyleen Schmidt says companies may have rushed requests through
to avoid a fee increase that went into effect Dec. 18. The agency
had not anticipated such a dramatic dip, she says.
But the drop-off shows the difficulty of tailoring immigration
policy to fluid economic needs, says Steve Camarota, research
director at the Center for Immigration Studies. "Now if we try
to cut back, who knows, maybe the economy will change again,"
he says.

Silicon Valley entrepreneur sees a different kind of crisis

SAN FRANCISCO -- Rajen Jaswa, a 53-year-old high-tech entrepreneur, is the classic immigrant success story in Silicon Valley.
After arriving in the USA three decades ago, Jaswa worked odd jobs and earned an MBA in night school. Now he and his wife live in affluent Saratoga, Calif., and their two sons attend Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley.
Jaswa still recalls those rough early years. "You come into this country with nothing in your pocket," he says, "and you never forget that feeling."
A graduate of the elite Indian Institute of Technology, Jaswa caught the first big wave of the U.S. technology boom. Through the 1980s, he worked on early, clunky mobile phones at the Harris Corporation and designed computer chips at Intel, the semiconductor giant.
Then entrepreneurial fever hit him in the late 1980s. He raised millions of dollars in venture capital and co-founded two successful technology startups: Opti, a computer chip firm, and Selectica, a software company.
Jaswa needed immigrants to build his global startups, so more than half of his employees were high-tech engineers and managers from India and Taiwan. "We had a fabulous pool of trained talent," he says. "We were Asian and American creations."
Many of Jaswa's workers had H-1B visas and other temporary work permits for professionals, who are in high demand in the U.S. economy. Competition was fierce for those employees because there are limits on such  visas.
Now Jaswa runs a consulting firm, Jaswa & Company, and is president of The Indus Entrepreneurs (TIE), a global network of Indian entrepreneurs whose members have launched 300 businesses with $350 billion in revenue.
Speaking for himself and not TIE, a non-partisan group, Jaswa sympathizes with illegal immigrants who have long been in the USA.
"If somebody has been an illegal immigrant for more than a few years," he says, "and has been integrated into the economy and American society, we should find a way by which they can become citizens of this country."
At the same time, Jaswa says businesses clearly need to monitor their workforces to ensure new immigrant hires are here legally. He says his companies have never hired undocumented workers.
Jaswa says the dramatic influx of immigrants since the 1960s has helped the U.S. economy become the world's strongest. Now the high-tech industry's shortage of well-trained computer scientists and engineers makes it critical for Congress to increase the number of visas available and open the borders more, he contends.
The annual quota for H-1B work visas is capped at 65,000 and fills up quickly. For years, technology, retail, health care and other companies have urged Congress to increase the numbers of visas for professionals and unskilled laborers.
"If we want to continue to prosper," Jaswa says, "we need to make it as easy as possible for talent to flow into the United States."

Over 30 years ago, my parents immigrated to the U.S. and have been productive contributors to the economy ever since. Today, countless more young immigrants arrive to this country with the same drive to better themselves. But 30 years after my parents' arrival, the skills needed to come have changed. That's why it's imperative that we protect the H-1B visa program. American innovation, our economy and  our democracy depend on welcoming the 21st century skills of young people from around the world.
The Pew Research Center found that 76% of Millennials say "immigrants strengthen the country."As the most diverse generation, Millennials value hard work and believe everyone should have a fair shot at achieving economic success. The values our country was founded upon mean ensuring that opportunity is within reach for anyone who is willing to put in the effort.
Both conservatives and liberals have made their support for increasing the number of H-1B visas given to skilled laborers, understanding the tax revenue, and expanding the diversity that skilled immigrants bring to the table. If we begin to push away immigrants, we may begin to see our most valuable industries outsource their operations abroad. We risk isolating communities that have  inspired a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship that is pushing young Americans forward.

When  H-1Bs crank up, wages could plummet because of cheap labor. Say a typical offshore firm charges about $25 an hour. If you hire an offshore company that has its labor in the U.S., you pay about $40 an hour to the company. But workers back in India make about $10 an hour. If companies are forced to hire local talent, they might invest in schools.
Bill Andrews
The H-1B don't bring "top foreign talent." They bring average talent at a cheap wage.
James Murphy
I have seen companies choose foreigners over local candidates. They aren't any more innovative or talented than what we have here.

We asked our followers whether the U.S. should expand or limit the number of work visas given to foreigners.
Expand! More people in the country means higher demand for goods and services! It's a win-win!
@CohenOrr
I watched as these immigrants with work visas took jobs from Americans because they worked cheaper. Restrict.
@skepticaljlw
Immigrants open more businesses in the U.S. than American citizens. More businesses equals more jobs and taxes. I love diversity.
@jones_medic
Limit work visas due to terrorism.
@RhondaRHolt2
Expand. The U.S. needs to maintain its competitive edge. There are not enough talented and educated U.S. workers, mostly money-greedy graduates.

Wanted: Immigrants needed in Pittsburgh New workers bypassing city built by sweat of Europeans
USA TODAY

PITTSBURGH -- One recent Saturday, a recruiting consultant named
Kenneth Rodriguez traveled 65 miles to Youngstown, Ohio, to chase
highly sought-after talent.
His quarry: a crew of 12 Hispanic fruit harvesters. His task:
persuade them to leave their work picking apples in the summer
and citrus in the winter to take landscaping jobs in Pittsburgh,
at $ 8 an hour with benefits.
Pittsburgh needs landscapers and welders and short-order cooks
and home health-care workers, employers here say. And there's
a major source of labor that Pittsburgh, unlike other cities,
has not been able to tap: the nation's growing supply of immigrants.
If immigrants are the lifeblood of American cities, as Census
2000 indicates, Pittsburgh could use a transfusion.
"Hispanics do not speculate on Pittsburgh," says Rodriguez,
who has recruited seven Hispanic workers this year, including
three from the Youngstown crew. "We come here because we are
brought."
Past and present
The wave of Hispanic and Asian immigration that is restocking
cities across the USA is bypassing Pittsburgh.
The city -- which for years powered steel mills with the labor
of Scots, Irish, Italian, German and Eastern European workers
-- today has virtually no immigration.
It ranked last among the top 25 metropolitan areas in the country
in the number of immigrants it gained during the 1990s: 8,935,
which is equal to 0.4% of its population, according to Census
estimates. That's half the rate of Cleveland, a city of similar
size that was next-to-last in immigration. During the same time
period, Cleveland drew 17,247 immigrants, or 0.8% of its population.
Immigration hubs New York City and Miami had rates of 11.3% and
16.4% respectively.
Population expert Chris Briem of the University of Pittsburgh's
Center for Social and Urban Research calls Pittsburgh's low immigration
rate "just scary."
He is not the only one who is alarmed. A growing number of people
in Pittsburgh are urging action to attract newcomers.
"We're missing waves of potential entrepreneurs," says Don Smith,
director of the Center for Economic Development at Carnegie Mellon
University."
Immigration "brings people who have ambition, people who have
a new culture. It brings actual bodies who can work," says Don
Carter, a principal in the architecture firm Urban Design Associates.
"If we want to be an entrepreneurial society again, we have to
get some entrepreneurs -- who may not be us."
Elsewhere, immigration is stemming and even reversing years of
population loss in the nation's cities. But not in Pittsburgh.
Here, the population within the city limits fell 9.5% -- from
369,879 in 1990 to 334,563 in 2000. That's its fifth straight
decade of decline. (Population for the six-county metro area declined
1.5% from 1990 to 2,358,695 in 2000.)
At the eastern end of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia's population
fell at a rate less than half of Pittsburgh's. Philadelphia's
4.3% drop to 1,517,550 was smaller than expected and was entirely
due to Hispanic immigration. Even small cities in the state such
as Allentown and Lancaster now have significant Hispanic populations.
The number of Hispanics in the city of Pittsburgh, whether newly-arrived
or born in the USA, is growing but still statistically tiny: 1.3%
of the population, or 4,425 people. That compares with 3.2% of
the population in Pennsylvania and 12.5% nationwide.
Pittsburgh does have a community of Indian medical and information-technology
professionals. Economic development groups are trying to draw
more of these educated workers, who often arrive in this country
on employer-sponsored H-1B visas for professionals.
They also are trying to persuade international students attending
local universities to stay after they graduate.
Allegheny County, for instance, has a task force to figure out
how to attract a greater number of high-tech workers from overseas.
A narrow focus
Immigration advocates say the focus on skilled workers is too
narrow. "They just imagine immigrants are people with a lot of
skill and a lot of money, which is not the way Pittsburgh grew,"
Carter says.
Ronald Lee arrived here when he was 8. His father, a businessman
in Hong Kong, started out in Pittsburgh washing dishes in a restaurant.
Now, at 32, the younger Lee has trouble finding dishwashers for
the two restaurants he owns and worries that the pan-Asia-Africa
menu may be too multicultural for local tastes.
"I don't mean to say that Pittsburgh is culturally insensitive,
but it does lack a certain diversity," Lee says.
And he's not sure the city's business-development focus will change
that. "Ethnic communities aren't started on the corporate level."
Catch-22 and backlash
Why aren't immigrants attracted to Pittsburgh?
Local economic development officials point out that the city is
not a port of entry to the USA, and it is far from cities that
are. Twenty years after the city's steel industry collapsed, the
local economy has largely recovered. Unemployment is close to
the national average (4.3%), but job growth has been slow.
There is also a Catch-22: It is hard for a city to attract immigrants
if few are there. An existing immigrant community spreads the
word back home about jobs and sponsors family members for visas.
Another obstacle, some say, is a culture that celebrates earlier
immigrants while being wary of the latest ones.
Pittsburgh is a city of neighborhoods, defined by the hilly topography.
Many of them, such as Polish Hill, still have a distinct ethnic
flavor from the waves of European immigration before World War
II.
The collapse of the steel industry, blamed on international competition,
generated hostility to foreigners.
"Only 20 years ago there was a pretty big backlash against foreign
workers," says Connie Reiter-Kreps, director of talent attraction
for the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance, an economic development
group. "This wasn't a very friendly city for immigrants."
That colors the way the issue is approached even now.
"Politically, the hot button is 'workforce development,' which
is a more acceptable statement than 'increase immigration,' "
Rodriguez, the recruiter, says.
Many who would like to see the community attract a wider variety
of people simply want a more varied feel to their city.
Karen Feinstein, executive director of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation,
recently organized a conference to discuss the regional shortage
of health care workers. And many other Pittsburgh service industries
could use an infusion of newcomers' hustle, she says.
"I don't think I've ever had a (Pittsburgh) taxi driver that
didn't speak English,' Feinstein says. "But then again, I've
hardly ever been able to find a taxi."
'Steel City' not a magnet for workers from outside USA
During the 1990s, Pittsburgh ranked last in immigration among
the USA's 25 biggest metropolitan areas.

Yes, U.S. technology companies would get more foreign scientific and engineering talent if Congress raised the cap on H-1B visas, as commentary writers Lezlee Westine and Scott McNealy urge ("Stingy immigration policy stifles U.S. innovation," The Forum, Wednesday). The two CEOs fail to mention, however, that lifting the cap would have two perverse effects:
*It'd take pressure off our state education systems, which are in drastic need of reform. For example, differential pay to attract scarce science or math teaching talent is verboten because of teacher union resistance. But according to a 2003 report, 60% of physical science teachers in grades 7-12 had neither a major nor minor in the field.
*It would also send a grim message to youngsters considering a major in science or engineering: Work hard, earn your degree in a very challenging field, and your government will suppress your salary and/or give your job to a foreigner.
America must decide: Should we become addicted to foreign talent via an expanded H1-B visa program? Or should we subject a dysfunctional education monopoly to deep structural reform?
My preference: a brisk dose of market competition in the form of school vouchers, selective science and math charter schools, and the like. Which course is in our long-term interest?

Legal immigrants wait
Unlike illegal immigrants, our family, including two teenage girls, followed the legal way to come into the USA. My husband, an IT specialist, was asked to come by a U.S. employer. We are from Holland, where some have had a weak spot for the USA since World War II; we took the step of moving to America in 2001.
After a visa, heaps of paperwork and an extension of the visa after three years -- the employer still needs my husband's skills. He also offers his skills to U.S. workers via  training. No other experts are available. So, we decided we wanted to stay. Despite legal hurdles, we like it here.
But, for the past year and a half or so, the Department of Labor has stacked applicants in backlog centers to see whether it is true that no U.S. citizen is available for the job. Officials promise a lot, but we are all waiting and waiting.
If the immigration legislation adds some millions of guest workers to that stack, what will happen to us legals?
That's why I was glad to see the commentary "Stingy immigration policy stifles U.S. innovation." I hope it raises awareness. But couldn't we legal immigrants get the front page for once?

Mexican state makes a pitch for U.S. tech; Jalisco governor faces tough sell as trade screws tighten

The governor of Mexico's state of Jalisco is visiting more than 40 U.S. tech companies with the message that it's a great place for high tech, the latest cross-border recruitment effort to respond to U.S. immigration policy.
Jalisco Gov. Jorge Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz will meet with California Gov. Jerry Brown, 13 large tech companies including Facebook and Google and 30 start-ups beginning this week.
It's an annual trip for officials from Jalisco, birthplace of tequila, synonymous with hot sauce and sometimes called Mexico's Silicon Valley for its already thriving tech scene.
This year, the trip has an added purpose: to talk to Brown about a bilateral agenda to support Mexican citizens to remain in the U.S. And, Sandoval will promote capital city Guadalajara and the rest of Jalisco as a friendly environment for skilled workers that may have trouble getting hired by U.S. tech firms if the Trump administration passes more restrictions on H-1B visas, as a draft order indicated.
"We want tech companies to know there is a huge opportunity in Jalisco for them to grow," Sandoval, who has created a cabinet-level Innovation Department, told USA TODAY in a phone interview Tuesday.
"Jalisco has many advantages" -- a close time zone to Silicon Valley, talent, strong university system, government support and infrastructure, Sandoval said. The Trump administration's policies, in particular the possibility of an executive order that could curtail H-1B work visas, also work in Jalisco's favor, he said.
The pitch is hardly a slam dunk. Some tech companies remain reluctant to expand in Mexico, with a threatened 35% tariff from Trump on goods made there looming as large as his much-heralded wall. (Trump floated the idea of a 20% tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall, though White House spokesman Sean Spicer said it was one of several proposals.)
There also are lingering questions about Jalisco's overall tech talent, poor broadband access in some areas and costs related to opening operations offshore.
Nonetheless, Sandoval's push to raise awareness about Jalisco comes at a time when the USA's northern neighbor, Canada, is also attempting to recruit tech workers. Canadian venture firms and companies are enticing U.S. start-ups with funding, sparkling new work spaces, broadband access and a relatively affordable cost of living.
Jalisco's pitch is similar. The state  on the western coast of central Mexico has blossomed into a thriving tech hub worth $21 billion. Guadalajara and coastal Puerto Vallarta are home to manufacturing, design and research-and-development operations for Intel, Hewlett Packard and Oracle, among others. Oracle and Intel house innovation centers in Guadalajara, and a 940-acre media-business center is under construction.
Technology goods represent about 55% of Jalisco's exports and account for 25,000 jobs in the state. Nearly a third of Mexico's tech business comes from Jalisco, according to a spokesman for Sandoval.
"The Jalisco government is 100% focused on technology," says Bismarck Lepe, CEO of San Francisco-based tech services firm Wizeline. "It's an ideal region for intellectual property and not cheap manufacturing."
Lepe has deep ties to Mexico. His parents are from there but left for the U.S. for a better economic opportunity. Lepe, who studied at Stanford University and worked at Google, decided to return in 2010 after a third-party analysis determined Guadalajara was fertile ground for tech talent. Half of Wizeline's 270 employees are in Guadalajara, most of them engineers.
"We want to make Guadalajara a tech hub for the world -- from multinational companies to midtiers and start-ups," says Cindy Blanco, general director of StartupGDL, a non-profit organization that champions the region. Guadalajara has lured entrepreneurs with a pool of tech talent fed by the university system, a comparable time zone (Central) to Silicon Valley and direct flights, Blanco says.
The close proximity of Mexico and Canada could offer concerned American companies -- and workers -- an option should Trump issue executive orders on a revised travel ban, curtail H-1Bs and revise the NAFTA trade accord.
Job seekers are likely to choose Canada as a backup. It was the most popular second destination, at 43%, followed by Australia (12%) and the United Kingdom (5%), based on 1,200 people tracked last week by Indeed, a job-search engine. Mexico was No. 12 on the list.
'Not an ideal solution'
Mexico is at a disadvantage when it comes to talent, tech executives say. Its engineering pool isn't as bountiful in Mexico as it is in India and China, and salaries for Mexican engineers are significantly higher because competition for them is so fierce, says Stephen Stokols, CEO of FreedomPop, a wireless Internet and mobile virtual network operator.
"Mexico is a primary market for us, but it's not an ideal solution," Stokols says. His Los Angeles-based company has 20 people -- about 10% of its worldwide workforce -- in Mexico City, mostly engineers. "We would have more people there if the engineering talent were available."
It can also be expensive to open operations south of the border and establish a payment system,  says Jesus Hoyos, managing director at Solvis Consulting, which resells tech products in Mexico.
Still, Mexico might offer a compelling case for job seekers turned away by the U.S. It is a huge trade partner with the U.S. -- trade between the two countries totaled $583.6 billion in 2015, according to the U.S. Trade Representative -- and is home to  more than 1 million Americans, the largest community for expatriates. (Nearly 40,000 American and Canadian expats are among Jalisco's population of 7 million.)

Teacher shortage gets foreign aid Schools seek help outside U.S. borders

Desperate to fill vacant teacher slots, Oak Knoll Elementary School
principal Iris Moran signed up three years ago for a program that
brings teachers from foreign lands to U.S. schools.
The intent of the Visiting International Faculty (VIF) program
is cultural exchange, but Moran says her initial purpose "was
almost just to help the situation" at her East Point, Ga., school
-- to replace teachers lost to retirement or maternity leave.
Only now does she appreciate how enriching it is to have teachers
from such countries as Chile, Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand,
Jamaica and Australia.
Other schools have taken similar routes to help fill a looming
teacher shortage that experts say will require 2.2 million teachers
over the next decade. The problem is compounded by the dearth
of teachers in math and science -- the two subjects in which U.S.
students are the weakest when compared with peers in other countries.
Many U.S. schools are pushing to recruit foreign teachers who
can help remedy both problems:
* Chicago, the nation's third-largest school district and
the second-largest employer in Illinois, is looking for 3,500
new teachers for this school year. More than 130 teachers have
been hired since August from 35 countries, including Japan, India,
Colombia, Pakistan, Ghana, Jamaica and Mexico.
* The Atlanta public schools have 400 to 500 vacancies
this school year, and recruiters have "scoured the earth for
teachers," says spokesman Seth Coleman. Recruiting trips have
taken school leaders to Jamaica, South Africa and Canada.
* The Los Angeles Unified School District is "always chasing
somewhere around 4,000" teacher vacancies annually, says Anthonio
Garcia, director of recruitment. Since last year, about two dozen
teachers have been hired from Spain, Mexico, Canada and the Philippines.
U.S. schools have about 200,000 vacancies a year in teaching,
estimates Betty Castor, president of the National Board for Professional
Teaching Standards. Colleges annually produce about 150,000 teachers,
"so you start off with a deficit of about 50,000," Castor says.
Foreign teachers must vie for the limited number of slots the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service allows for temporary
visas, known as H-1B. Only 107,500 such visas were allowed in
fiscal 2001, and U.S. employers pay $ 500 for each.
Recruiting foreign teachers for U.S. schools should be considered
only a "short-term solution," says Bob Chase, president of the
National Education Association, which represents 2.5 million teachers.
"It's a big mistake if folks think this is a long-term solution.
It's more a question of retention than bringing people into the
profession," Chase says.
Barbara Radnor of DePaul University in Chicago says foreign teachers
can "enrich our system," but adds: "We need to look again at
teacher preparation in general and what we do to support teachers
in the first few years. That's the question we are avoiding with
these programs." Radnor's Center for Urban Education is training
Chicago's foreign teachers.
Until these issues are resolved, however, school leaders are meeting
their personnel needs with such teacher recruitment programs as
VIF, the Teachers Replacement Group of Plainview, N.Y., and the
Global Educators Outreach Program.
Moran has used the VIF program to add 10 teachers from Mexico,
Chile, Great Britain, Canada, Jamaica and Australia over the past
three years. "It brings a different flavor to the school" at
a time when there has been an influx of Hispanics to the predominantly
black community, he says.
Rick White, personnel director for Fulton County, Ga., says the
programs are cost-effective for smaller school districts such
as Fulton's, which has 71 schools and an enrollment of more than
70,000. It would be too expensive for some districts to form their
own overseas recruiting teams, he says.
"They do a good job of screening and making certain that teachers
are ready to be certified," White says.
The VIF program, based in Chapel Hill, N.C., brought 1,300 elementary
and high school teachers to the USA this year, with most going
to a handful of states, including the Carolinas, Georgia, Virginia,
New Jersey, Colorado and California. They teach every subject,
from home economics to languages.
David Young, a co-founder along with his brother, Alan, says VIF
was created in 1987 as a cultural exchange for teachers and "was
really not based on the teacher shortage."
To address its teacher shortage, the Chicago Board of Education
developed a partnership two years ago with the U.S. Department
of Labor and the INS. Called Global Educators Outreach, it recruits
math, science, languages and bilingual education teachers.
"The principals literally fight over these candidates," says
Jorge Oclander, senior assistant to the Board of Education. He
says this year's recruits include Romanian physicists. Overall,
15% to 20% of those recruited have doctorates, and all are fluent
in English. The teachers are assigned to some of Chicago's tougher
schools but don't flinch at the challenge because of their experiences
in their homelands, Oclander says.
And then there are poor rural counties, like Richmond, N.C., which
has attracted a South African physics teacher and a technology
instructor from Kingston, Jamaica. Ralph Robertson, principal
of Richmond Senior High School in Rockingham, is excited about
the recruits because few young, talented U.S. teachers would come
to the area. He uses the VIF program.
"There's not a lot in Richmond County to attract a single person
to come. Plus, we pay just a base state salary. A person can go
to Charlotte, Raleigh, Winston-Salem and earn $ 5,000 more and
have enriched cultural and nightlife activities," he says.
In training the Chicago teachers, Radnor says, there are many
challenges, including getting them to understand the new focus
on standards. "We don't have a national curriculum in this country,"
like many foreign countries, Radnor says. "Not only do they have
a national curriculum, but they are based on the European model,
which is lecture. And our kids do not want lecture."
The foreign teachers have their own complaints. Many find that
U.S. students are not as motivated and tend to be discipline problems.
However, Claudia Cuervo, a Spanish teacher from Chile, says her
pupils at Oak Knoll "have been very receptive, very aware of
the importance of learning a foreign language." She was one of
57 VIF participants teaching in Fulton County this school year
and was named teacher of the year.
Cuervo, who has been teaching 11 years overall, begins her third
year teaching Spanish to fourth- and fifth-graders at Oak Knoll
this fall. "Of course sometimes you have some discipline problems,"
she says. But "children are children everywhere. My mission is
to make a difference in their lives."

Asians are becoming more vocal in the debate; Community is taking part in push for change

In New York City's Chinatown, Asian immigrants held hands and formed a "human chain" at 12:16 p.m. Monday to highlight the day, Dec. 16, when the House of Representatives voted for a bill that would make illegal immigrants felons.
In Philadelphia, Korean activists held a forum on immigration. In Los Angeles, they encouraged employers to let workers take the day off to join a march down Wilshire Boulevard.
Latinos have been the face of recent immigration rallies, but Asians and Asian-Americans are increasingly joining the protests or taking their own approach. They are speaking out on issues such as reducing the wait times for visas for family members or green cards for skilled workers.
"This is a turning point for them. More Asians are joining into this larger civil rights movement," says Pueng Vongs, an editor at New America Media, a consortium of ethnic news media.
"Our community has been fairly slow to mobilize, but we are definitely working together now," says Daniel Huang, policy advocate for the Asian Pacific American Legal Center. He says Spanish radio stations helped Latinos organize quickly for rallies, but varying languages mean it's harder to reach Asians that way.
People of Asian ancestry were 13% of the 11.1 million undocumented population in a 2005 Census survey, says Jeffrey Passel, senior research associate at the Pew Hispanic Center. Four countries -- China, India, the Philippines and South Korea -- accounted for most of them.
Korean-Americans have been among the most vocal Asians in the immigration debate, Huang says.
"We have a particularly large undocumented population," says Eun Sook Lee, director of the National Korean-American Service and Education Consortium. She says 18% of the Korean population in the USA is undocumented.
Vongs says Korean-American businesspeople, who hire substantial numbers of Latinos, are concerned about penalties they could face as employers.
The Korean Apparel Manufacturers Association in Los Angeles sent a memo to its 1,000 members urging them to allow workers to take Monday off.
"We don't want this to be a racial issue," says Mike Lee, the group's president, noting that many of the employers are Korean-American but the workers are Latino. Lee, a former U.S. Army officer who owns an apparel factory, joined a march Monday, as did all his Latino workers. Only a handful of his Asian workers took the day off.
The Chinese community has been less active until recent weeks, Huang says, noting their large turnout at rallies April 10.
"Chinese are sort of a quiet, conservative community," says Cat Chao, host of the radio call-in show Rush Hour on Chinese-language station KAZN in Los Angeles. She says that when Latinos organized the initial protests, many of her callers admired their activism. Now, she says, many say the activists have gone too far and call Monday's boycott too "aggressive."
Aman Kapoor, a software programmer from India at Florida State University, didn't join the boycott. His venue: the Web. Four months ago, he posted a message about his years-long, ongoing wait for a green card, which documents an immigrant's permanent legal residence in the USA. He says 3,400 workers like him, who have H-1B visas to take "highly skilled" jobs employers couldn't otherwise fill, formed Immigration Voice. Most come from India or China.
"We don't know the system here," Kapoor says, explaining why the group hired the lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates. The firm is helping the group urge senators to expedite the green-card process and change rules so some applicants enduring a long wait could change jobs.
More than other immigrants, Asians tend to be well-educated, professionally employed and in the USA legally, Passel says. About 10% of the Asian and Pacific-Islander population in the USA is undocumented, compared with 19% of the Latino population, he says.
The difference in legal status helps explain why the Asian community is less concerned than Latinos about legalization, says Karin Wang, an attorney for the Asian Pacific American Legal Center.
In a March poll of 800 legal immigrants by New America Media, 39% of Asian-Americans favored deporting all illegal immigrants; 9% of Latinos supported the idea. Forty-seven percent of Asian-Americans favored erecting a wall along sections of the U.S.-Mexican border; 7% of Latinos did.
Vongs says Asian immigrants are more concerned about human trafficking, the smuggling of people into the country for forced labor, sexual exploitation or other illicit purposes. "The highest number of people trafficked are Asian," she says. "It's primarily for the sex trade."
Civil liberties is another issue, Huang says. He says the House bill would make some misdemeanors, including drunken driving, a reason to deport someone. That could leave some people in U.S. prisons indefinitely because some Asian countries -- Vietnam, Laos and China -- permit few deportees to return.
Reuniting families is another concern of Asian-Americans. Huang says children or spouses of U.S. citizens wait one to two years for a visa to the USA, but parents, siblings and other relatives wait five to 12 years.

Worker advocates anxious on visas; Deadline looms, but Trump hasn't signed order to protect American jobs

Three weeks before the federal government is set to start issuing an annual allotment of visas for foreign workers, advocates for Americans displaced by foreigners are worried President Trump won't take action in time to fix the problem, and thousands more American jobs will be lost.
Numerous companies have outsourced work in recent years to contractors that use foreign labor, mainly tech workers with coveted H-1B visas. That includes companies such as Disney, New York Life and Toys R Us.
Last week, the University of California-San Francisco laid off 49 IT employees after outsourcing much of their work to a contractor based in India, the Mercury News reported. Workers with H-1Bs facilitated the laid-off employees' training of their replacements.
Trump promised on the campaign trail to "end forever" such "rampant, widespread H-1B abuse." A draft executive order that leaked in January directed administration officials to "restore the integrity" of the system and prioritize and protect the "jobs, wages and well-being of United States workers."
The president has yet to sign it, and companies can start applying for the new batch of 85,000 H-1B visas April 1. In previous years, the annual allotments have been exhausted within days.
"If you do not take action in the next few weeks, outsourcers will secure the right to import tens of thousands of low-wage foreign guest workers to replace American workers," Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., wrote in a letter to Trump.
The White House has given little indication of Trump's intentions on the issue. After the draft order leaked and again on Wednesday, spokesman Sean Spicer said only that the president is reviewing the matter as part of a larger overhaul of immigration policies.
"I think there is a natural desire to have a full look, a comprehensive look, at that," he said.
The H-1B visas are supposed to help fill gaps in the U.S. labor market by allowing companies to hire foreign workers when they can't find enough Americans with the skills to fill the positions. The number of visas each year is capped at 65,000 for workers with bachelor's degrees or higher, plus 20,000 for workers who obtained master's degrees or higher from a U.S. institution. There is no cap for institutes of higher learning.
Critics said companies have exploited the program to bring in foreign workers with lower pay rates than Americans.
Ron Hira, a professor of public policy at Howard University, concluded that the companies receiving the most H-1B visas in recent years have been firms based in India or American subsidiaries that bring in foreign workers and take over IT functions as contractors that once were performed by American workers. "Tens of thousands of people, I estimate, have been replaced directly or essentially replaced," said Hira, author of Outsourcing America: What's Behind Our National Crisis and How We Can Reclaim American Jobs.
Tech industry specialists said the majority of H-1Bs go to multinational American companies competing in a global marketplace that can choose to take those jobs elsewhere.
"They'll just expand their facilities in the Czech Republic or in Singapore or wherever it might be because they have a global demand they have to satisfy," said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. "Or they will lose out on contracts and sales, and then foreign companies will gain global market share."
For Trump, the issue presents a challenge: How can he fulfill promises to protect and create  jobs while growing the U.S. economy and making it easier for U.S. companies to do business.
Supporters of reining in H-1Bs were buoyed when he named a supporter of their cause, Stephen Miller, as a top adviser and when the draft  order leaked. Their hopes have dimmed as weeks have passed without action.
Durbin said he had thought the issue would be one of the few where he agreed with the White House.

The deadline for companies to present their border wall proposal to the Trump administration was Wednesday. Meanwhile, others argue that moving toward a merit-based system for legal immigration would be better.
You're either here legally or you're not. Not hard to understand, even for liberals. Why don't immigrants come legally?
Bob Frankl
Wouldn't it be nice if the greatest country in the history of mankind actually produced high-skilled laborers, so we didn't have to import them from developing countries that need them more than us?
Paul Hackett
I think we need less immigration all the way around. We need to end chain migration, birthright citizenship and the lottery, and bring only those who are truly in need. As far as those coming to America for an education, they need to return home after they're done and help make their country better.
Evelyn Mills
Canada has had a merit-based immigration system. It makes perfect sense to do the same here.
James John
Our own citizens should have the opportunity to be hired first for whatever jobs are available, before we allow foreign workers to come here for employment. At the present time, companies are using H-1B visas to import foreign workers and take jobs from U.S. citizens, only to boost their bottom line. This is wrong and needs to stop!
William Koontz
The border wall is simply a populist boondoggle. If you are a conservative, why waste billions of dollars on a project that does nothing to combat illegal immigration? Most of our undocumented immigrants don't come across that border. Right now, more immigrants leave through that border than enter. Let's make rational, non-partisan decisions. Enforcing E-Verify is a good start.
Scott Hardy

TWITTER
We asked our followers if they thought a border wall with Mexico would be approved and constructed under President Trump.
A border wall between Texas and Mexico won't be built. Add border agents.
@baylor_sunny
No border wall will go up. Trump will not be in office that long, he can't even pass a bill.
@SeasonO1
I don't know, but I hope not. Chances are slim to none, as neither the American nor the Mexican people want it.
@Judy7kay
I hope not. Why would anyone in government give him billions of dollars to build a wall that will not work?
@mikendetroit
No way. Trump will be impeached and probably jailed long before ground is broken on it.

'Brain drain' shifts into reverse

SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Faisal Saleem moved to Silicon Valley to chase the American dream. Now he's returning to Pakistan because his job prospects are brighter there.
Saleem, a 29-year-old software engineer, came to the USA 18 months ago to work at a tech start-up. Laid off in October, he can't find another job. He's moving home. "It's the same story everywhere," he says.
No one knows how many South Asian professionals have left the USA as layoffs this year in the technology and telecom sector hit an estimated 470,000.
But Indian and Pakistani business leaders say it could be in the thousands -- the first major reverse migration since the workers started arriving in big numbers in recent years to fill ample tech jobs.
Layoffs prompted workers to leave before Sept. 11. But the economic fallout from the attacks may accelerate the trend -- especially as people of color face increased scrutiny in the USA.
"It is another reason why a lot of Indians and Pakistanis are going back," says Web designer Shiv Singh, 24. The Boston Indian Sikh wears a turban and has been singled out for searches in airports.
U.S. tech companies still expect to win top talent from overseas when they hire again. And U.S. consulting firms, which get work visas for foreign workers, then contract them out to tech firms, say they're deluged with laid-off workers desperate to stay in the country.
But as an already robust software industry in India grows, tech executives say it is getting easier to keep talent in India.
About 52% of people responding to a recent poll on www.justindian.com, a Web site for Indian-Americans, said laid-off Indians should go home instead of looking for new jobs in the USA.
"There are a number of bright, young, educated people who came here and who have had to go back," says Kailash Joshi, president of The IndUS Entrepreneurs, a Santa Clara, Calif.-based support group for Indian professionals. In India, "they're all trying to start their own consulting or management firms."
'Little India' hurt
The USA has definitely lost its appeal for Sunil Swaroop, a 29-year-old software engineer from Milpitas, Calif.
He's moving back to India -- even though he is still employed and has no job lined up overseas -- because the "situation here is so bad, I don't want to stay here anymore."
Swaroop, who has been in the USA for 18 months, is worried about getting laid off. His wife's visa does not allow her to work in the USA. He's concerned he will suddenly have no way to support his family.
"I can't get paid this much in India," he says. But "if something goes wrong with my company, I'm nowhere."
The departure of people such as Swaroop is being felt most in Silicon Valley's Little India, where many South Asian tech workers settled.
Business has fallen 30% in the past several months at Pasand India Cuisine, a sweet-smelling restaurant on a busy Sunnyvale street. The restaurant is still busy from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., when most of its non-Indian customers eat, says manager Venkata Vemireddy. But 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. used to belong to Indian "single men on (work) visas," Vemireddy says. "Now, we don't see them."
A few blocks down, once-coveted parking spots in front of Bhavika's Food to Go are easy to find. Inside the restaurant, fliers advertise entire households for sale -- cheap. The Sunnyvale Salvation Army has been taking calls from departing families that say "take everything -- TVs, sofas, everything," says supervisor Elias Trevino. "They say they're going back to their country."
About 400 customers of the Bharat Bazar, a nearby Indian grocery and clothing store, have moved back to India, says owner Veena Birla. Her business is also off 30%.
Some fight to stay
U.S. jobs have long been coveted by many South Asian professionals, who sought higher salaries and U.S. lifestyles. Wages in India for software technicians, for example, are about half what they are in the USA, Joshi says.
The most recent figures available show that more than 34,000 Indians came to the USA between October 1999 and February 2000 on the H-1B visa used most often by tech companies, the Immigration and Naturalization Service says. Indians held 43% of H-1B visas, dwarfing the next-largest group, Chinese workers, 4-to-1.
While the INS doesn't keep track of layoffs of H-1B visa workers, workers such as Saleem say the community is being hit hard as layoffs and reduced hiring take hold. "We have seen a general slowdown in recruitment the world over," says Kiran Karnick, president of the Indian National Association of Software and Service Companies.
But while some immigrants are happy to return home, others are trying anything to stay. Restaurant manager Vemireddy gets three or four phone calls a week from laid-off tech workers desperate for any job.
Paul Singh, manager of Sunnyvale Rangoli Indian Cuisine & Sweets, gets two to three calls a day from job seekers. "They're so desperate. They're crying," he says. "They're asking for a part-time job, anything."
Rapidigm, a software consulting company in Pittsburgh, is getting more applicants from the ranks of laid-off H-1B workers.
Gurmeet Singh took a job hundreds of miles from his wife so he didn't have to return to India after earning his MBA in June from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y. His wife is enrolled in medical school in Albany, N.Y. He's working at a temporary job in Falls Church, Va. They've thought about returning to India, but prefer the U.S. lifestyle. Singh, 37, spends his spare time looking for a company to sponsor him on a long-term work visa. He's had no luck.
India benefits
Technology companies with offices in India are benefiting from the U.S. layoffs. Wipro, the country's largest software firm, says it is easier to hire and retain skilled employees in India now that the USA has lost some appeal.
Syntel, a Troy, Mich.-based company with operations across India, has also profited from the trend. Skilled programmers have been easier -- and cheaper -- to come by in India, now that they're seeking steady jobs close to home, spokesman Jonathan James says.
Syntel, which develops software on a contract basis often for U.S. companies, relies on the low cost of doing business in India. Because salaries and other costs are lower, it can offer services 25% to 35% cheaper than if it were doing the work in the USA. Most major software makers, including Microsoft and Oracle, have development offices in India.
The desire for a steady, safe job is what motivated Saleem, the Pakistani software engineer, to decide to leave the USA. After getting laid off from Redwood City, Calif.-based eWanted.com, he's returning to his old position at VisualSoft Technologies, based in Hyderabad, India.
"Here, I'm like an alien. It's hard to survive. Over there, it's no problem," he says. "I have a good job."

Plenty of tech jobs, but ... few workers who have the chops; By 2020, there will be 1.4M more software development jobs than qualified applicants

Jobs creation has been the mantra of President Trump. But in some industries such as tech, the U.S. doesn't need more jobs -- it needs workers with more of the right skills.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts there will be 1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020.
The problem: A "perception gap" between educators and employers has left scores of jobs unfilled, according to new research from the Career Advisory Board, which closely tracks the jobs market.
Only 11% of employers believe higher education is "very effective" in readying graduates to meet skills needed in their organizations, according to the January survey of 501 U.S. hiring managers, human resource specialists and executives. Some 62% said students were unprepared.
The jobs gap is especially pronounced by age: 72% of respondents agreed that Millennials are keeping pace with technology but only half of Baby Boomers are, the survey said.
There are  more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide, but less than 43,000 computer-science students graduated into the workforce last year, according to Code.org, a non-profit group dedicated to expanding access to computer science.
Last year, the White House claimed the federal government alone needed an additional 10,000 IT and cybersecurity professionals.
Trump has yoked his political success to creating new jobs. Many of the successes he has claimed have involved traditional manufacturing, a once steady and high-paid sector that's declined with automation and offshoring.
This week, he touted the creation of 150 U.S. jobs at Ford Motor (moves in the works before his administration) and signed an executive order rolling back Obama-era climate change regulations in a bid to create more jobs for coal miners.
The availability of so many tech jobs -- particularly in coding, the Internet of Things, big data and cybersecurity -- presents an opportunity for Trump to make good on his promise to help frustrated workers while pursuing a $1 trillion infrastructure plan and major changes to the H-1B visa program, educators and tech leaders say.
"The jobs are already here," says Rob Paul, president of DeVry University, which conducted research online for Career  Advisory Board and offers educational services that includes boot camps for tech skills. "Speed is of the essence in filling them."
The emergence of boot camps has slightly eased the problem in getting thousands of Americans up to snuff in skills for coding, Internet of Things, big data, cybersecurity and high-tech manufacturing but doesn't go nearly far enough, Paul and others say.
"When I worked within Silicon Valley, it boggled my mind -- there were so many available jobs," says Randi Zuckerberg, CEO of Zuckerberg Media, which is partnering with DeVry and others to "get kids, especially girls, excited" about science, technology and math. Zuckerberg's 6-year-old son took a course in robotics.
"A lot of progress is being made, but we need to ramp it up," says Zuckerberg, whose brother is Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook.
"Every company now is really a tech company, with needs for social media, supply management and distribution. The jobs will grow exponentially."

Worker visa lottery holds little promise for immigrants

This is my family's fifth year living and working in the USA. My wife, Karen, and I came here on an L-1B visa, a temporary worker permit for non-U.S. citizens who work for international companies with U.S. offices.
Karen is a registered nurse, and I am an engineer. Naturally, Karen, my two sons and I have come to consider this country home.
Our youngest son, Aiden, was born in Cincinnati. We recently bought a house in Katy, Texas, and we have grown to love our community.
Basically, we are living the American Dream. Unfortunately, all this may soon come to an end.
My green card priority date, November 2006, is backlogged by several years.
My company, which is sponsoring this application, has been advised to move me into the H-1B visa, a visa for workers with highly specialized jobs.
The L-1B visa is valid for  a maximum of five years. The H-1B visa can be renewed until we finally can file our green card applications.
My attorney filed for the H-1B visa on the first available date, April 2.
Unfortunately, so did more than 100,000 other applicants. Our future will be decided by a computer that randomly picks visa numbers until it reaches about 65,000.
Statistically, we have about a 50% chance of success. I find it almost impossible to explain to my family that our future will be decided this way.
I have no idea how to explain to my youngest son, a U.S. citizen, that we might be forced to leave the country of his birth.
Something must be done -- especially when the future of families can be decided by a lottery draw.
An immigration bill before Congress increases the number of available H-1B visas.
If Congress fails to act on this fiasco, our family -- which is attempting to legally obtain citizenship in this great nation -- might be forced to give up the American Dream.

Undermining Americans
USA TODAY's article "Foreigners seeking high-skilled worker visas hope to beat the odds" glosses over the real issues with worker visas (News, May 1).
The article almost makes it seem as if there is a crisis because U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently got more than 123,000 applications for the H-1B worker visa.
The truth is that these visas are being used to bring in cheap labor for businesses and to undermine American workers.
Do you know that H-1B visa tech workers are paid, on average, $12,000 per year less than U.S. citizens working in the same position, according to the Center for Immigration Studies? How is this mathematically possible if companies are following the law?
After all, the H-1B has a "prevailing wage" requirement as well as requirements that jobs be posted for American workers before being given to an H-1B worker. The simple answer is that the H-1B program has always been about cheap labor.

'Panic' as last-minute H-1B visa measures hit; Because of the timing, it's too late to change applications for 2018

A shakeup of the controversial  visa program that allows foreigners in specialty occupations to temporarily work in the United States hit just as the brief annual window to apply for the coveted visas opened -- too late to amend applications, lawyers say.
The Department of Homeland Security on Monday announced new measures to "deter and detect" fraud and abuse in the H-1B visa program while the Department of Justice issued a warning to employers not to discriminate against Americans.
These warnings followed a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services memo Friday that it would no longer consider entry-level computer programming positions as specialty occupations that potentially automatically qualify for the visa.
"It's a bit strange to have this so-called guidance go out as people have already prepared papers," said Ted Ruthizer, partner and co-chair of the law firm Kramer Levin's business immigration group. "It's set off a panic among employers and foreign nationals around the country," he said.
H-1B visas are granted to allow companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations such as science and information technology and are most commonly used by tech companies seeking computer specialists.
Only 85,000 are issued each year and must be filed on paper, via mail. The application pool typically is closed within a week because there are so many applicants. Those applications began flooding into U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Monday, even as notices about the changes were posted.
Given the timing of the notices, it is too late for applications for 2018 to be changed, said Mark Koestler, also a partner at Kramer Levin.
"Even if you wanted to redo anything because of this memo, you don't have time to because the Department of Labor piece of the application, which has to be done prior to submission, takes seven days," he said.
Monday's new measures focus on agents making more site visits to employers to combat visa fraud.
"The Justice Department will not tolerate employers misusing the H-1B visa process to discriminate against U.S. workers. U.S. workers should not be placed in a disfavored status, and the department is wholeheartedly committed to investigating and vigorously prosecuting these claims," acting assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Civil Rights Division said in a statement.
The immigration agency will focus especially on companies considered "H-1B dependent," meaning 15% or more of their workers are on H-1B visas.
The visa program long has been controversial, with some complaining that companies use them to hire cheaper tech labor, often from India, while qualified Americans are passed over. President Trump has vowed to end the system, which he says doesn't  protect American workers.
In 2016, 236,000 foreigners applied for an H-1B visa, meaning only about one in every three applicants won one of the coveted spots. The tech world has made heavy use of the visa program, saying there are not enough American workers with the necessary skills to fill needed positions.

Don't waste U.S. brainpower by hiring foreign workers for coveted jobs

I've heard the arguments in support of using the H-1B, or specialized worker, visas to fill our country's technology positions with foreign employees. Some have said that businesses need to harvest the brainpower from abroad because qualified Americans don't exist and that H-1B visas are the only way to keep the USA competitive in the global economy. But this argument only paints a picture of America as a nation full of idiots.
The truth is that there are fully qualified American job candidates, such as myself, who are trained right alongside foreign graduate students studying here.
To say that qualified candidates don't exist in the USA contradicts the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. In this case, the "Help Wanted" sign now reads, "Americans Need Not Apply."
Five years ago, I graduated with a master's degree in aerospace engineering from a U.S. university. Back then, I heard about a fellow classmate from Pakistan who was immediately assisted in getting an engineering job before his student visa expired. To this day, I have yet to land a comparable engineering position, though my credentials declare me equally qualified. Recently, since the quota for foreign employees has temporarily been filled, I've begun receiving more interest by engineering recruiters. But if the cap on H-1B visas is further increased, I might never find a decent technology job in the USA.
It's regretful we are wasting our country's most important resource -- brainpower -- by farming out our highly honored jobs to cheap foreign labor. If this continues, the rest of us might be settling for cut-rate, low-skill jobs.

Visa process is 'black hole'
The United States is a great country. It has adopted people from many different nationalities with open arms. It is the land of hope and opportunity for millions of immigrants like me. My wife and I have one dream -- to provide a secure, prosperous tomorrow for our children. We want our children to grow up as hard-working individuals and to call the USA their home. But we don't know whether our dreams will come true.
In early 2002, my employer started the process of applying for my permanent residency. But after almost five years, I am still waiting in an endless queue. I have been told I might have to wait for at least three more years because the yearly quota of immigrant visas is not enough for the number of applicants. For the same reason, thousands of qualified doctors, engineers, nurses and other professionals are stuck in the immigration black hole. It is sad to see such a rough situation for highly qualified individuals in the USA.

Swap service to stay
To secure a system of accountability in immigration reform, I have a suggestion for the U.S. government:
Every man or woman ages 18 to 42, who can pass a background check and can physically handle military service, should be granted U.S. citizenship after serving for a minimum of six years. The French were successful with their foreign legion. Why doesn't the United States have its own? If immigrants want to use our social services, public education and hospital emergency care, then they must give back by serving our country. This would show their allegiance to our Constitution and laws, and officers and non-commissioned officers would need to learn English.
Why rely on the legal citizens in our military when there are 12 million illegal immigrants here who are not doing their share?

Hurdles hurt workers
I can only empathize with the difficult and bizarre hurdles that individuals and families face as they legally try to make a new home in the USA. I am not a U.S. resident, but I unsuccessfully have tried to gain employment in the USA.
After retiring as a Royal Air Force officer specializing in air traffic control for 18 years, I applied to the Federal Aviation Administration for one of the many controller vacancies. But an FAA administrator told me I could not apply for the position because I was not a U.S. citizen. I then applied for and received a study visa to complete an FAA aircraft dispatcher course. I successfully completed the course and was awarded the license.
Even so, airlines seem reluctant to employ foreigners post-9/11 because of the extensive background checks that are mandatory for aviation workers.
As a retired military officer whose home country, the United Kingdom, is considered a close ally of the United States, and as a former air traffic controller whose responsibility was to keep safe the U.S. military aircraft and personnel in Europe, it seems I am regarded as a threat. Apparently, having served as a military officer for 18 years doesn't count for anything in today's society.

Singapore, Poland eager to step up if doors close here; The H-1B visa curb could boost tech jobs in those nations, survey says

Increasingly tough measures facing applicants to the U.S.'s coveted pool of highly-skilled visas are most likely to boost countries such as Singapore and Poland, a new report says.
Those countries and several others, including Taiwan and Finland, are poised to benefit most in drawing engineering talent, according to a study published Thursday by online technical recruiting platform HackerRank. It assessed the attractiveness of countries based on local talent, salaries, cost of living, Internet speed, time zone, government corruption and skill levels of developers in each country.
"If we make it harder for people to come to the United States, it could lose out on talent, investment and innovation, which would have deep ramifications on the U.S. GDP and growth," says Ritika Trikha, a lead researcher on the report.
Singapore, Hong Kong and other countries with fledgling tech industries have dangled perks such as lower taxes and a skilled workforce to poach talent from the U.S., often with mixed results. But many now see an opening after an abortive travel ban and the Department of Homeland Security's announcement Monday of new measures to "deter and detect" fraud and abuse in the H-1B visa program. The Department of Justice also issued a warning to employers not to discriminate against Americans.
The potential defection of jobs overseas would be a blow to President Trump, who vowed on the campaign trail to be the "greatest jobs producer that God has ever created." More than 600,000 tech jobs were unfilled in the U.S., as of the fourth quarter, according to an annual analysis of the nation's tech sector by technology association CompTIA this week.
"Ultimately, there is opportunity for work anywhere in the world if you're skilled in (engineering and coding)," Trikha says.
Singapore, which has emerged as Asia's newest technology darling, outranked others for beneficial business taxes and Internet speed, according to the study.
Singapore ranked as the best place for tech talent by the tech bootcamp Startup Institute, helped in large part by its government's five-year, $19 billion research and development plan, announced in early 2016. Google is on a hiring spree, opening a new office building last year and expanding to 1,000 employees. Singapore is headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region for Google, Facebook and Twitter.
Poland received high marks for its developers, who ranked third worldwide in the study, and its affordable costs in establishing a developer team.

Layoffs, fewer jobs may force many immigrants to go home

The economic downturn means scores of immigrants who poured into this country on special visas for skilled workers face little choice but to return home.
Here's why:
 * Layoffs. Many immigrants have arrived in the USA on H-1B visas, which mean that their ability to stay hinges on employer sponsorship. But as companies downsize, these workers are finding themselves out of jobs. Their visa status ends as soon as they're downsized.
Case in point: Dozens of those laid off from Enron were on H-1B visas and may have to return to their native countries.
"It's sad, really," says Margaret Wong, a Cleveland-based immigration lawyer who says her caseload has tripled in the past year. "Most of them don't want to go home. They may have children in school here."
 * Fewer jobs. Many immigrants here on H-1B visas are finding it's tougher to get employer sponsorship because the recession has dried up hiring prospects.
Many visas had been issued to workers in the high-tech sector, which had suffered from a worker shortage. But now that industry is reeling from job cuts.
That's one reason some politicians and labor leaders are calling for a reduction in the number of skilled immigrants allowed into the USA. In 2000, the number of immigrants with H-1B visas allowed into this country was raised from 115,000 annually to 195,000. Last fall, legislation was introduced that would reduce that maximum to 65,000, although hearings have not been held on the proposal.
H-1B visa holders also are facing a post-Sept. 11 anti-immigrant sentiment that has some companies leery of hiring non-citizens. In addition, the recession has critics saying the H-1B program is taking valuable jobs away from Americans in need of work.
According to a survey by Techies.com, an online provider of career resources, 85% of respondents say worry over losing jobs to non-citizens is the primary reason H-1B policy is controversial.
As many as half a million immigrants on H-1B visas came to the USA in the 1990s, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
"If I get laid off, it's going to be really hard to find an employer," says Bernadette Rose, an Australian working in Atlanta on an H-1B visa. "It is very scary, because I took out a $ 10,000 loan to buy a car, pay for moving fees, hiring a lawyer, etc."

Businesses seek to revive parts of immigration bill; Tech, farm workers among top priorities

WASHINGTON -- The business community is already pushing to resurrect portions of a wide-ranging immigration bill that died in the Senate last week.
Among the priorities for business are provisions to allow more highly skilled workers into the country each year and expand programs for farm workers
"We're going to have to go back and see how many things from the bill we can pull out and get fixes," says Angelo Amador, director of immigration policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who also said his group would push to give undocumented students who have been raised in the USA a chance to earn legal status and finish their education.
"At the very least a fix for a year or two while we work on comprehensive reform is needed," Amador said.
Amador added that businesses face increasing immigration raids and new legislation at the state and local levels.
It's not clear how eager lawmakers will be to dive back into the controversial issue, though Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has indicated a willingness to consider parts of the bill separately. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, said the House should "take stock of the situation to determine whether anything can be done to improve the current unsatisfactory system."
The Senate failed to muster the 60 votes needed to end debate on the immigration measure. It would have given a path to citizenship for an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants now in the USA, tightened workplace enforcement and border security, and allowed more temporary workers.
With the bill apparently dead, the technology industry will back a more targeted measure increasing the number of annual H-1B visas for highly skilled workers. The visas are issued for up to three years but can be extended. The bill would have raised the current cap of 65,000 to as many as 130,000. The industry  now will push for an annual level as high as 195,000 annual visas -- a number allowed several years ago.
"We've got a lot of companies who want to create a lot of new jobs and keep a lot of good people in the country," says Ralph Hellmann, a senior vice president of the Information Technology Industry Council.
The American Farm Bureau Federation will continue pushing for a farm worker program, probably more expansive than the one in the failed bill. That program provided a path to legalization for about 1 million current agricultural workers and made it easier to use a guest worker program.
"It's an issue we've been working on for a long time ... we're not going to stop," says Paul Schlegel, director of public policy for the American Farm Bureau Federation.

H-1B visa holders might get more expensive - and better educated; New Executive Order seems to look toward auction-like system

Companies that want to fill positions with non-U.S. workers on H-1B visas will end up having to pay them more -- and they'll likely need to be better educated in general -- under a new  executive order signed by President Trump  that could make the business model of tech outsourcing firms less viable.
The  order is  light on details but one crucial phrase could signal its intent. Government agencies are to suggest reforms that ensure H-1B visas go to the "most-skilled or highest-paid."
"Right now, H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery, and that's wrong," Trump said at the signing ceremony at Snap-On Tools in Kenosha, Wis.
How that might be implemented is not addressed. Options might include moving from the current lottery model to something more like an auction, experts say.
For example, it could mean "if a company is offering $140,000 for one position and another is offering $70,000, the $140,000 is going to be selected," said Ted Ruthizer, a partner and expert in immigration law at the New York firm of Kramer Levin.
In the educational realm, it might mean putting Ph.D. holders above those with master's degrees, who would be above those with  bachelor's.
The largest impact likely would be on outsourcing companies such as Tata and Infosys, which have built lucrative businesses by bringing computer professionals, often from India, into the U.S. on H-1B visas -- the specialized work visas favored by the tech industry.
Currently, 35% to 40% of H-1B visas go to these types of  staffing companies, said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, a science and tech-focused organization that lobbies for immigration reform. His group has advocated for immigration reform that would, among other things, raise the salary floor for these visas above $60,000, the figure at which they can skirt restrictions on displacing Americans.
The floor was set by Congress in 1991 but because it was not indexed to inflation, it now represents the y lowest end of the wage scale for skilled tech workers.

Better visas could ease nursing crisis

Length: 466 words

A recent story in USA TODAY touched on an important issue facing all Americans: the severe nursing shortage in the health-care industry ("Nursing crisis at crossroads," Life, Sept. 17).
Beyond the debate on how best to fix the problem in the long term is the cold fact that studies have revealed that patients are needlessly dying because of the problem.
Unfortunately, steps taken so far by the health-care industry and the government have been inadequate.
A bill signed by President Bush this summer offers incentives to help nursing school recruitment. While that is a step in the right direction, it does not address the immediate demand for more nurses.
Most nurses who enter the country each year have to cut through mountains of red tape before they are granted a green card that allows them to work in the United States, or obtain one of the 500 H-1C visas, granted specifically to nurses each year.
A better and quicker way to alleviate the nursing shortage would be to allow foreign nurses to enter the country under H-1B visas, which are less restrictive and apply to all specialized workers.
There is hope that such a measure could become law through a Senate bill whose sponsors cut across party lines. The bill would allow 100,000 foreign nurses to attain H1-B visas each year. They would have to pass the same testing as American nurses before they would be allowed to touch patients.
There is no time to waste in alleviating the nursing shortage, which is expected to explode by 2020. The health of Americans depends on it.

Giuliani and baseball
I second USA TODAY columnist John Saraceno's nomination of Rudy Giuliani to become Major League Baseball's next commissioner ("Jones can play the heavy vs. Ruiz," Keeping Score, Sports, Friday).
Giuliani has been a loyal baseball fan since childhood and still is to this day. He is also knowledgeable about the game and is certainly someone who could earn the respect of owners, players and fans.
Current MLB Commissioner Bud Selig has not been a very good steward, and I have always been uncomfortable with his being a team owner. Consider:
 * MLB's decisions regarding the Twins and Expos: a move to fold the teams.
 * Selig's ridiculous ending of the last All-Star game: It was tied.
Baseball's failure to deal with its labor and financial problems are all good reasons to bring Giuliani on board.

Making math pay; Good teachers appear when the price is right

Annie Lerew has always loved math. Home-schooled by a math-loving mother in rural Pennsylvania, she spent hours discovering theorems by trial and error. She realized that a good teacher could bring complex concepts to life. Even so, when she majored in math at Albion College in Michigan, she planned to become an actuary. "I thought being wealthy was the thing to do," Lerew says, and she wasn't excited about the "life of poverty" teaching implied.
Then she Googled "math jobs" and found something that changed her mind -- an ad for Math for America. This program based in New York, primarily funded by billionaire hedge fund manager Jim Simons (and unrelated to the better-known Teach for America), pays for mathematicians to earn a master's degree in teaching, and gives an additional $90,000 stipend over five years to supplement their public school salaries. Intrigued, Lerew applied. She earned her master's at Bard College  and now teaches a combination math/earth science class at Banana Kelly High School in the Bronx. Most weeks, she leads her  students to points on the Bronx River to measure temperature, salinity and other variables. The kids learn algebra as they analyze the results. "For an extrovert, teaching is great," she says. "I really love my job."
Unfortunately, highly qualified math teachers like Lerew are in short supply these days. Mathematicians have many opportunities in our increasingly technical economy -- opportunities that  are far cushier than teaching teens.
But as Simons has discovered -- and is telling the Business-Higher Education Forum's gathering of Fortune 500 CEOs and others in Miami this week -- extra cash can boost supply more effectively than the altruism Americans have long relied on to recruit teachers.  If employers want to hire mathematically literate workers in the future, cutting checks to the teachers who can train them is not a bad way to go.
Quality and quantity
It's no secret that American students lag behind many other nations on international comparisons in math. In the 2003 Program for International Student Assessment, American 15-year-olds ranked 24th out of 29 industrialized nations in mathematical literacy.
Meanwhile, everyone from Wall Street to tech companies has developed a voracious appetite for people with quantitative skills. "Employers understand that without H-1B visas" -- which let highly skilled foreign workers come to the USA -- "the economy would be sunk," Simons says. He reports that Americans hold only about 25% of the technical positions at Renaissance Technologies, his fund. Diverse companies are great to work for, but immigration is only a short-term solution; these days many skilled Indian and Chinese workers stay home.
It's also no secret that teacher quality is closely correlated with student outcomes. While figuring out what constitutes "quality"  is itself a complicated equation, in math, studies point both to content mastery and -- interestingly -- teachers' scores on standardized tests. On both dimensions, America's teaching corps has troublesome stats. A quarter of high school math teachers lack even a minor in their teaching field. In 2007, the average SAT math score for prospective education majors was 483 out of 800; for all college-bound seniors it was 515.
Aside from the quality issue, there's also a quantity issue. Since mathematicians have many opportunities outside of teaching -- and since school districts generally pay teachers by tenure, not demand -- schools suffer from a chronic shortage of math teachers.
Economics 101
Economists have a simple answer for boosting quality and quantity: Pay math teachers -- and others in demand, such as physicists -- more than other teachers. As former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan notes in The Age of Turbulence, "A flat pay scale when demand is far from flat is a form of price fixing."
Setting a market price for teachers has proved tough to do with public money, though. The National Education Association states on its website that the single salary schedule is the "fairest" way. A new federal compensation program, modeled on Math for America, was passed into law as part of the America COMPETES Act, aiming to boost Americans' technical skills.  But Congress appropriated only $5 million for this program, less than the New York program spends locally on its roughly 160 fellows and "master teachers" -- high-quality, veteran math teachers who receive a four-year, $50,000 stipend to stay in the profession.
That's too bad, because this is a national issue. And even if we can't get our public priorities straight, private-sector players can do a lot to solve the problem without the politics involved in winning public money. (Randi Weingarten, head of New York's teachers union, sits on the board of Math for America.) When Simons wanted to create his program, he wrote a check. As a result, New York City lands about 40 new math teachers a year -- average math SAT score: 726 -- who might not have chosen the profession otherwise. He has lined up donors in Los Angeles and San Diego to start similar programs and is looking for partners  elsewhere.
It shouldn't be a tough pitch. For a business worried about the quality of its future workforce, $50,000-$90,000 is a small amount. It matters to teachers, though.
Nic Vitale, another Banana Kelly math and science teacher, was starting to get "a little worn out" after eight years in New York City's classrooms. "A lot of people were asking me, 'Why don't you move to the suburbs?'" he says.  Then he heard about Math for America's master teacher program. Soon, he was attending professional development programs, mentoring young teachers such as Lerew -- and cashing his bonus checks. "Now, nobody asks me why I'm here," Vitale says.
Why would they? He's being paid like the professional he is.

Is the H-1B visa system finally headed for reform?
On Tuesday, the White House issued an Executive Order directing federal agencies to offer improvements to the annual H-1B lottery, favoring an approach that allocates guest-worker visas to the "most skilled or highest-paid applicants." The H-1B visa was designed to attract the world's best talent. But critics  long have complained the program is abused by global outsourcing firms.
It's not just that H-1B visas often go to guest workers with common skills, displacing higher-paid American tech professionals in the process. The bigger issue is how they accelerate the offshoring of U.S. jobs. At the same time, certain tech jobs are already coming back to America. Unless we understand these two deeper trends, visa reform could be useless at best and harmful at worst.
Having workers onsite is essential at the beginning of an offshoring engagement. Typically, these are guest workers with H-1B visas. But as these workers gather information about systems and processes in the U.S., their firms gradually transition 60% to 95% of the work overseas. Lower labor costs offshore mean savings for U.S. clients and higher profits for outsourcers. Thus the H-1B has enabled an offshoring bonanza. The Indian tech industry makes about 60% of its $100 billion-plus revenue through jobs outsourced by U.S. companies.
Despite these savings, U.S. businesses have discovered IT offshoring isn't a silver bullet. The reason comes down to the nature of modern software development itself. Developers today rely on frequent, real-time communication and collaboration with their colleagues, partners and clients. Waiting for a team member on the other side of the world isn't always practical.
A new breed of 100% U.S. "domestic sourcing" companies, including mine, has emerged. We build software for some of America's most successful companies. We employ hundreds of tech workers in places such as Michigan and Indiana, which have relatively low costs but also a wealth of local universities and  talent.
At Nexient, we do sometimes hire H-1B workers if we cannot find a citizen with a critical skill -- exactly as the program was intended. In fact, the first one we hired is now a U.S. citizen.
This suggests we need to be careful with H-1B reform. Increasing the number of H-1B visas could perpetuate the existing problem. Limiting their availability might feel politically satisfying but could push U.S. companies to accelerate offshoring programs.
Smart reform needs to reduce incentives to offshore jobs that can be done better in the U.S. It needs to encourage trends returning high-paying, innovation-driven tech work to America while giving U.S. workers time to transition to a quickly automating world. For example, companies that sponsor H-1B visas for their employees should  commit to sponsoring their green cards.
Reforming the  system won't stop offshoring, nor should it. But  restoring the H-1B program to its original intention and giving U.S. workers a path to sustainable careers in tech, we can support middle-class growth and contribute to America's lasting economic success.
Orttung is the CEO of Nexient, an Agile software, design and strategy provider. Currently 11% of its workforce holds an H-1B visa.

Bills to keep jobs in USA create uproar

WASHINGTON -- Just three years ago, Congress voted to allow more foreign workers into the United States. Times have changed.
Politicians are proposing tough -- opponents say misguided -- steps to keep jobs at home in the face of rising unemployment, a growing number of white-collar jobs being transferred to India and other countries and lingering anger over some U.S. allies' opposition to the war in Iraq.
The House has passed measures to require the Defense and State departments to buy a larger share of equipment from U.S. firms. The measure, which has provoked a corporate and political uproar, has not been approved by the Senate.
Legislators in several states are trying to bar the export of government jobs to foreign companies.
Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., chair of a Judiciary subcommittee, plans a hearing today on possible problems in the L-1 visa program, which allows companies to bring workers to the USA from their foreign operations. Workers complain that firms are using the program as a backdoor way to replace domestic employees with cheaper labor.
The number of such visas has tripled in the past two decades, Chambliss' office says. Immigration experts say hundreds of thousands of such visas have been granted in the past several years.
There is also controversy over a separate H-1B visa program, which allows firms to hire skilled workers from abroad. In 2000, Congress voted to raise the cap on such visas to 195,000 at a time when the tech industry was still begging for workers. The cap will drop to 65,000 in October unless lawmakers extend the current program or, as some want, abolish it.
Politicians are reacting to the loss of 2.6 million manufacturing jobs since mid-2000, and studies predict millions of service jobs -- call centers, engineering, architectural drafting and others -- will move abroad in the next decade.
Earlier this month, Gartner, a technology research and advising firm, predicted the amount of business processing done by workers outside the USA would reach $ 1.8 billion in 2003, a 38% increase from 2002.
Many corporations and analysts call the legislative moves misguided efforts that will impede, rather than spur, job creation. Defense contractors warn that a House-passed amendment requiring the Defense Department to have 65% U.S. content in goods it buys, up from 50%, will have huge consequences.
"The Department of Defense provision is what we call a unicorn provision -- because what they want to buy doesn't exist. Flat-panel screens are no longer made in the United States," says Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America. "You would have to recreate those industries in the United States, and those industries would exist for only one client, the Department of Defense," he says.
Rep. Don Manzullo, R-Ill., whose district includes a number of factories, plans to offer so-called Buy American amendments to every spending bill that comes through Congress this year.
"You just can't continue to outsource overseas time after time after time, dilute the strategic military base and then expect this Congress to sit back and see the jobs lost and do nothing," Manzullo says.
This is not the first time Congress has tried to ratchet up Buy American provisions in an economic downturn. Military leaders protested Buy American amendments during the 1980s, at a time when the administration persuaded Japan to place voluntary limits on the number of cars its automakers sold here.
The current efforts are not confined to the federal level. The New Jersey Senate voted to bar the state from granting contracts to firms abroad.
Though the bill died in the House, and opponents complain it would increase costs, its sponsor will bring it back this fall. Other states, including Maryland, are considering similar bills.
"I've been in the Legislature now for 10 years, and I have never received as much correspondence from people as I have with this bill," says state Sen. Shirley Turner, D-N.J., who has gotten more than 2,000 pieces of mail and phone calls about the legislation.

Small businesses see swelling optimism; Owners are putting money behind rosy outlook, survey shows

U.S. small businesses are brimming with confidence -- and backing up their upbeat outlook with a burst of hiring and spending.
Sixty-four percent of firms with 100 or fewer employees say their businesses are doing well, up from 61% in late 2015, according to an Allstate/USA TODAY survey of 2,790 such enterprises in mid-February.
And 72% of the respondents anticipate they'll do well in the coming year compared to their current performance, up from 64% in late 2015. The  results represent a positive harbinger for an economy that's expected to record meager first-quarter growth in a report due  Friday.
In a barometer that rates small businesses' overall health, Nashville, Orlando and Tampa ranked highest while New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Philadelphia trailed.
While the business owners' perceptions appear to have been brightened by the election of President Trump, who has vowed to cut taxes and regulations, they're also rooted in improved sales and the fading of economic headwinds that lingered long after the Great Recession ended in 2009.
Fifty-five percent of the businesses say their revenue has increased the past year, and half say it has grown more in the three months prior to the survey than in the same period last year, up from 51% and 43%, respectively, in the earlier poll.
"Small businesses are definitely more upbeat than they have been in about a decade," says Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner, who frequently meets with small companies.
In fact, 64%  say there never has been a better time to own a small business, and 56% hope to leave their businesses to their children, up from 53% and 44% in late 2015.
"This is the best economy I've experienced in the business," says Ryan Shortill, CEO of San Diego-based Positive Adventures, which conducts outdoor retreats for corporations and private schools to teach team-building, conflict resolution and risk-taking, among other qualities.
During and after the recession, he says, many firms slashed training budgets as revenue plunged and remained cautious for years. Now, "I see companies starting to loosen the purse strings," especially in light of a new focus on the overall well-being of employees.
Noting that sales have doubled so far this year compared to the year-ago period, Shortill says he plans to add 10 to 20 part-time instructors in coming months to his current stable of 40. He also has nine full-time staffers.
There are other reasons small firms are optimistic. Vitner cites a rise in oil prices that has sparked a rebound in the energy sector, noting many crude producers are small concerns. And average U.S. wages are rising more rapidly as the 4.5% unemployment rate forces employers to bid up to attract fewer available workers. That's putting more money in the pockets of consumers, who are also benefiting from solid job growth, reduced debt, cheap gas and near record stock and home prices.
And business loans, which were difficult to obtain from wary banks after the downturn, have become more accessible, in part, because of the spread of online, non-bank lenders. Sixty-one percent of the surveyed business owners who recently borrowed money said it wasn't difficult, up from 59% in late 2015. Twenty-one percent tapped an online or alternative lender, compared to 15% in the previous survey.
These enterprises aren't just talking a good game; they're opening their wallets. Thirty-four percent of those polled said they added at least one new employee in the previous three months, compared to 22% in late 2015.
And in a separate March survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, 64% of small businesses said they made a capital expenditure over the previous six months, matching highs reached in 2005 and 2013.
The performance and optimism of small businesses appears to defy an economy that many analysts estimate grew at an annual rate of 1% or less in the first three months of 2017, less than half the recovery's tepid 2.1% average. A possible explanation: Firms with fewer than 100 workers, which make up about a third of total U.S. employment, aren't as vulnerable to the vagaries of international trade.
But Vitner, the Wells Fargo economist, says the Allstate survey is further proof that weak first-quarter growth estimates in recent years are likely off-base because of the government's challenges in making seasonal adjustments that account for harsh weather and other factors.
For many small businesses, Trump's election served as a booster shot for their confidence. While Trump hasn't yet eliminated any regulations, he has signed executive orders launching reviews aimed at rolling back financial and climate change rules and broadly scrapping two regulations for every new one created.
The president also has vowed to cut the tax rate for small businesses -- which typically pay an individual rate of up to 39.6% -- to 15% to 20%, though his proposal likely faces a bruising battle in Congress. For years, small firms have pointed to taxes and regulations as among their biggest obstacles to growth.
Even though Trump has yet to take concrete action, 55% of the small businesses surveyed described the current regulatory environment as reasonable, up from 40% in late 2015. And just 45% said it's burdensome, down from 60%. Also, 19% cited taxes among their two biggest problems, down from 23%. Not surprisingly, Republican owners were more sanguine than Democrats.
"There's a management team working now that's talking about growth and tax changes," says Bill Dunkelberg, NFIB's chief economist. And so some small enterprises are already investing and hiring in anticipation of a more pro-growth backdrop, he says. "You don't bet money on the future if that future looks dim."
6D Global Technologies, a New York-based digital marketing company, has hired six employees this year, bringing its total U.S. staff to 62, says CEO Tejune Kang. He says he's keeping pace with a double-digit rise in revenue but is also emboldened by Trump's proposed tax cuts that he says will free up cash for investment. And fewer financial regulations, he says, will make it easier for 6D to eventually go public and increase profits for his banking clients so they can do more projects with his firm.
Kang is even encouraged by Trump's plan to restrict H-1B visas. He says that would hurt other technology firms that rely heavily on immigrant software programmers. But while they're scrambling to replace the foreign workers he would have an advantage, because he mostly employs Americans. He plans to hire 20 to 30 American interns this year, most of whom will be converted to full-time programmers.
"We're poised to have strong, aggressive growth because of the political climate," he says.
Yet not all  view Trump as a positive influence. EcoPlay Playgrounds of Atlanta, which makes more durable playground equipment, saw revenue triple in the first quarter vs. a year ago, in part because of a recent flurry of multifamily complex construction. CEO Kent Gregoire says he nearly doubled his staff to 16 this year and plans to spend $85,000 on new software systems.
But he refuses to take out loans that would spur even faster growth because he worries Trump's volatility could lead to wild swings in interest rates. "It's the lack of predictability," he says.
Despite the generally favorable environment, small businesses face new hurdles that are increasing their costs. Fifty-one percent of those surveyed said the prices they pay for materials and equipment are higher than last year because of rising commodity costs.
And a skimpy pool of available workers is making it tougher to find job candidates, forcing business owners to boost pay or benefits. Thirty percent said hiring and retaining employees is challenging, up from 25%.
Kang says it's taking two to three months to fill job openings, compared to three to four weeks a couple of years ago, estimating that sales would be at least 10% higher if he could recruit more rapidly. In response, he has increased total compensation, including salaries and signing bonuses, by 15% to 20%.
Shortill says he's getting about 30 applications for a typical job opening compared to about 50 several years ago. Because of that and a desire to reward loyal employees, he has increased salaries 10% this year and is considering a profit-sharing plan. "It is a tougher market out there," he says.
Gregoire says positions typically stay open three months, compared to three to six weeks a couple of years ago. But instead of hiking pay, which he says is already competitive, he's touting the company's culture.
"Our employees are personally empowered to make decisions," he says. "There's lots of freedom."

U.S. tech firms hire more foreigners here, too

U.S. tech companies aren't just sending work overseas. They're also trying to hire more foreign workers in the USA.
Congress approved 20,000 new visas for skilled foreign workers this month. To qualify for these H-1B visas, a worker must have a graduate degree from a U.S. university. They must also have a job offer from a U.S. company. And the company must verify that it cannot find a U.S. worker to fill the job.
Tech companies say they need visas because they can't find enough talented scientists and engineers here. There were originally 65,000 H-1B visas allocated for this fiscal year, which started in October. They were all claimed the first day. Unlike the 20,000 new visas, those first 65,000 required only a bachelor's degree or foreign equivalent.
"We don't want to turn away the best and the brightest," says Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, a tech trade group. Forcing foreign students to leave the country after earning degrees in U.S. schools "is cutting off our own nose to spite our face," he says.
But critics say tech firms like foreign workers mainly because they're a plentiful, cheap labor pool. Hiring them "helps to undermine the American middle class," says Dan Stein, president of advocacy group the Federation for American Immigration Reform. "Whatever happened to on-the-job training?"
Use of H-1B visas soared during the tech boom, when companies struggled to fill positions. The number of annual visas was raised to 195,000 in 2001.
They became controversial when the industry tumbled later that year, causing thousands of workers to lose jobs. The H-1B visa cap was eventually lowered, forcing many foreign workers to leave the country. The current increase was included in a giant spending bill President Bush is expected to sign.
Many tech firms say these ups and downs hide the real problem: the poor quality of U.S. math and science education. Intel CEO Craig Barrett claims the USA is falling behind rivals because kindergarten through 12th-grade math and science classes don't prepare students for college. That means many students choose other majors. China, for example, graduates about five times as many engineers as the USA.
Tech firms have also been criticized for moving work to India, China, Canada and other countries. They say they do that to cut costs and to find more skilled workers.
Tech professionals are split on the issue. Bob Slater, 47, a tech manager with Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, says he knows many talented engineers and programmers who are "selling houses because they can't find a (tech) job."
But DeVry University professor Tom Bock, 57, says most professors at his New York school are from other countries. "We can't get technical people to teach here that are born in the United States," Bock says.

A corporate 'feeding frenzy'; Visas push is about helping companies rather than workers

Today we are watching an amazing spectacle: Many in Congress -- including allegedly labor-friendly Democrats -- are pushing to increase the importation of foreign labor just as the USA slips into what may be its worst recession in decades.
Why? Because the greed of a handful of multinationals is demanding more and more access to "skilled" foreign labor.
Sure, we hear bogus "studies" that claim garden-variety foreign programmers will save the U.S. economy. But former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently admitted the real agenda: "Significantly opening up immigration to skilled workers ... would compete with high-income people, driving more income equality." In 2007, he further opined that, "Our skilled wages are higher than anywhere in the world. If we open up a significant window for skilled (foreign) workers, that would suppress the skilled-wage level and end the concentration of income."
Thanks, Alan! Having shipped so many good jobs overseas, we now find that U.S. workers who acquire job skills are overpaid!
Since 1990, Congress has allowed U.S. and multinational businesses to use foreign "nonimmigrant" visa programs to drive down wages and displace American workers. What began as a short-term fix for a supposed "short-term" shortage of programmers has turned into another elitist feeding frenzy for greedy people at the top of the food chain.
The use of foreign workers has exploded at a time of rising economic insecurity. Since 1985, the number of foreign worker admissions has increased by 426%, while the U.S. civilian workforce has only increased by about 29%. This is a "temporary" shortage? The main culprits are the H-1B and L-1B visa programs with meaningless labor protections now filling more than a million jobs.
Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Richard Durbin, D-Ill., are making a valiant effort to curb the excesses. But as with most other bloated immigration programs that become oversubscribed, Congress' first reaction is not to eliminate the loopholes. It's to just raise the numbers.
Don't get me wrong. My organization supports competing to attract the world's best and brightest. Jacking up the level of H-1Bs won't get us there.

Oracle sharpens claws in fight for cloud market; Tech giant lays down gauntlet to competitors as it expands its geographic, business reach

Oracle is preparing to intensify its reach for the cloud.
In an  interview with USA TODAY here, company co-CEO Mark Hurd laid out its latest battle plan, laying down the gauntlet to rivals Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Salesforce. "They can say what they want, but our strategy and momentum are irrefutable -- we are the fastest-growing cloud company at scale," he said when asked about Amazon and recent criticism.
Bravado and fighting words aren't new to the $183 billion-market cap company, which minted money in the 1990s and 2000s by aggressively inking contracts for database services and sales analytics with America's premier corporations. Then along came cloud computing, a revolutionary technology that offered flexibility, discounts and a break from multiyear enterprise contracts -- the backbone of Oracle's revenue machine.
Led by Oracle co-founder and executive chairman Larry Ellison, the company belatedly plunged into cloud computing, ginning up the rhetoric -- and sinking money into acquisitions -- to fight rivals for the $60.3 billion market in the U.S.
This week at a conference in Las Vegas, it plans to expand the geographic and business reach of its newly acquired NetSuite cloud business, as well as release a human-resources software product. It'll add new artificial intelligence and chatbot capabilities to its suite of customer experience applications that support commerce, marketing, sales and service professionals.
Separately, NetSuite is more than doubling its data center footprint to 11 and adding Oracle data centers in Frankfurt, Australia, Singapore, Japan, China and Chicago.
The future for Hurd, a famed salesman snapped up by Ellison after Hewlett Enterprise ousted him, may hang on whether Oracle can use its deep pockets and corporate relationships to make that turn.
Its rivals aren't holding back.
Six months after Ellison boasted "Amazon's lead is over," Amazon Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels last week ridiculed "old world" legacy companies -- a shot against companies such as Oracle and Microsoft -- for what he called "punitive" licensing practices. Vogels claimed customers have migrated 23,000 databases from those "old" companies to Amazon.
Microsoft, engaged in its own high-stakes transformation away from software licensing revenues, is also gunning for Oracle. For a year, its SQL Server Database systems has been advertising a road map to how customers can "break free from expensive Oracle solutions that hassle you with mysterious, frustrating pricing plans and surprise add-on fees."
Hurd joined the fray in February at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco, when he called Amazon's infrastructure "old" and praised his company's as "newer and fresher."
Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment on Oracle's latest cloud moves.
There is a method behind the saber rattling: Oracle's future and relevance is pinned on its ability to become a bigger player in cloud. The company's revenue has been near flat the past four years as major businesses migrate to cloud-based alternatives and software-as-a-service and away from software licenses.
As the world leader in database software, Oracle argues, it has an advantage in the all-important market for corporations to parse reams of data floating in the cloud.
But it entered the cloud market late and trails Amazon ($20 billion in projected 2017 cloud-related revenue), Microsoft ($12.3 billion), IBM ($11 billion) and Salesforce ($9.3 billion), according to Forrester. Oracle is projected at $5.6 billion this year.
"They're not moving fast on cloud. Where are the new developers?" said John Rymer, an analyst at Forrester. "The developers who show up at Oracle World are established partners. Amazon and Microsoft are spurring much more interest."
The business opportunity for cloud computing is immense. About 30% of 6,200 corporations from 31 countries are spending on cloud solutions, according to research firm IDC. The figure is expected to jump to 43% in 24 months as big business migrates to the technology for competitive reasons.
The cloud battle is in its "early days," but Oracle's position is "strong" because it has a "founder's advantage -- somebody like Ellison who can prioritize this transition above all else and push for strong execution," says Robert Mahowald, an analyst at market researcher IDC. It also boasts applications, a database business and storage products to give it a well-rounded offering, he says.
Then there is the Trump factor.
Oracle is one of the few tech companies with an apparently cordial relationship with the president, who has angered the industry with his stances on immigration and H-1B work visas while antagonizing executives with tweets.
The company's other CEO, Safra Catz, was a member of Trump's transition team and serves on his business advisory council.
"Oracle is a global business. We are pro-growth and pro-policy that supports the interests of our customers and employees," Hurd said when asked about the company's relationship with Trump.
He said 65% of the company's revenue comes from outside the U.S.
For now, the obsessive focus is on tech transformation.
"Whenever you go into these big transitions, you change a lot of things," Hurd said. "We're spending more on R&D, changing the way we sell and opening more data centers (for the cloud). And we're coming out of this quite well."

AVON, Ohio -- Tom Demaline is an all-American success story. But he's the first to say it wouldn't be possible without the Mexicans who work for him.
From a small landscaping company that his father founded in 1954 "with a pickup truck and a wheelbarrow," Demaline and his sister, Cathy Kowalczyk, built one of the largest nursery operations in the Midwest. Their Willoway Nurseries has 800 acres in production, grows 1,500 varieties of plants, and sells to landscapers and garden centers from Iowa to Maine.
Of the 350 employees hired to work the March through December busy season, 271 are Mexican nationals with visas from a "guest worker" program designed to fill jobs for which, employers say, no American workers can be found.
The presence of Mexican laborers in this Cleveland suburb, readying roses and hydrangeas for Mother's Day, illustrates how much foreign migrant labor means to the economy. They also underscore why a Senate debate, which could begin today, is so explosive.
Lawmakers are wrestling with the first overhaul of the nation's immigration laws in more than a decade, against a backdrop of conflicting emotions. The USA is a "welcoming society" and a nation of immigrants, as President Bush told new U.S. citizens after they were sworn in on Monday. It is also a nation where self-styled "Minutemen" volunteers patrol the U.S.-Mexican border, because of their frustration with a stream of illegal newcomers.
Bush believes the best way to end the black market in labor, which has drawn an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants to the USA, is to legally expand opportunities for foreigners to take jobs that Americans don't want. "By creating a separate legal channel for those entering America to do an honest day's labor," he said Monday, "we would dramatically reduce the number of people trying to sneak back and forth across the border."
The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday endorsed Bush's approach, approving a bill that would expand guest-worker programs and give workers who are now here illegally a chance to become citizens.
Employers from Demaline to Microsoft mogul Bill Gates have been pushing for more guest workers. High-tech companies say they need more talent, and the federal government agrees. In 2004, the U.S. Department of Labor certified a need for more than 600,000 guest-worker visas for high-tech workers, but under current law only about one-tenth could enter.
At the other end of the skill spectrum, Demaline says he had so much trouble recruiting Americans to do the "hard, dirty" seasonal jobs he was offering at $9.21 an hour that he thought he might have to sell his nursery. He credits the Mexican workers with saving his family business.
Even so, others believe America's open door is draining the economy. "Millions of American workers, in all sectors of the labor market, have seen their jobs and wages undercut by the phenomenon of mass illegal immigration," says Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors tighter immigration laws. He says expanding the guest-worker program "will only exacerbate the plight of middle-class workers in America."
The debate has opened a fault line in the Republican Party.  Leaders of the Republican-controlled House have refused to take up Bush's guest-worker proposal. They're focusing instead on enforcement.
The House bill by Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., passed in December, would make illegal immigration a felony and increase penalties on employers. It would also expand 14 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexican border by 700 miles, at an estimated cost of $2.2 billion.
The Senate bill takes a different approach, with no criminal penalties for illegal immigrants. It incorporates a bipartisan plan, by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to allow temporary workers to become citizens. The measure endorses Bush's view that those workers should not get a jump on those who have been waiting for years to become citizens.
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist signaled opposition to a guest-worker plan. The Tennessee Republican, who is exploring a presidential bid, introduced his own immigration bill earlier this month. It's unclear whether he will choose his bill or the committee measure for the full Senate debate. Like the House bill, Frist's measure focuses on enforcement.
Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, scoffs at efforts to "build a Berlin Wall" along the border. Donohue, who supports the president's guest-worker plan, says illegal and legal immigrants to the USA are responding to market demand. "We absolutely need these workers," he says. "We need these people for jobs that there are no Americans available to take."
Trades in need
In 2004, the Department of Labor approved 628,595 requests for high-tech worker visas. However, Congress caps the number of high-tech worker visas, known as H-1B visas, at 65,000 a year. That means some companies don't get the high-tech workers they request, even though federal officials have found their need to be legitimate.
For another, broader category of temporary work visas -- used to admit restaurant and hotel workers as well as minor league ball players -- the Labor Department certified 106,471 requests in 2004. These visas, known as H-2B, are capped at 66,000 annually.
Employers say Congress' unwillingness to raise the caps has made it difficult to find enough workers. "Like it or not, there are a lot of undocumented workers in our industry," says Gary Roden of Dallas, former national president of the Associated Builders and Contractors. He says the building trades are "in drastic need"  of carpenters, plumbers and heating and air-conditioning technicians.
He blames a society that favors white-collar professions on the lack of American workers in these trades. "School counselors and parents feel like their kids are failures if they don't go to college," he says.
The guest-worker visa program used for seasonal farmworkers such as those at Demaline's nursery admitted 22,000 workers in 2004, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. There are no caps on these visas. These workers are among more than 800,000 crop workers, only 47% of whom are legally authorized to work in the USA, according to the Labor Department.
Growers who use the legal guest-worker program say it isn't used much because it is cumbersome to obtain worker visas, which must be certified by the Labor Department, immigration services and the State Department before foreign workers can be admitted to the USA.
"You have so many different departments involved, all these little hoops you have to go through. If you have any little glitch, you lose your workers," says Luawanna Hallstrom, chief operating officer of Harry Singh & Sons, a California tomato grower. "We have told growers, 'Don't get into the program until you absolutely have to.'"
Demaline says he enrolled in the guest-worker program in 1998,after immigration agents raidedhis nursery and sent many of his Mexican workers back across the border.
"We were surprised," says Demaline, adding his employees' work papers appeared to be legitimate and many of the workers "spoke good English."
Demaline didn't know until after the raid that many workers were crowded into single-family rental homes while they worked for him.
Problems in process
Demaline used to rely on Cleveland-area high school and college students to fill seasonal slots at his nursery, but he says they aren't showing up at his hiring office anymore. He thinks they found easier work at area restaurants and shops.
State unemployment figures indicate that low-skill workers in Demaline's area can afford to be more choosy: In Lorain County, where Willoway Nursery is, the unemployment rate stood at 5.8% at the end of last year.
For Demaline, enrolling in the guest-worker agricultural program has meant hiring a Washington law firm to help with the paperwork, building dormitories that meet federal and state health department standards, chartering buses to transport Mexican workers, and starting Spanish classes for his American employees.
This year, the Labor Department made him advertise for farmworkers in newspapers and radio stations in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, as well as interview applicants from Ohio unemployment offices. Demaline says he got three workers from Texas and about 100 from Ohio -- though many of those, he says, don't stay. He needs guest workers to fill the rest of the jobs. "It's not a cheap source of labor," he says.
For Demaline's Mexican employees, the guest-worker program means paying a recruiter in Mexico to put them on the visa list. Francisco Ricardo, in his eighth season at Willoway, says he paid $400. Then the workers wait, sometimes for days, to win approval from the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey.
This year, a paperwork problem had to be untangled by Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. Until it was solved, the workers returned to Mexico and waited two weeks before they got permission to cross the border.
The workers spend nine months a year away from their families, but they say they are able to give them a better life. Ricardo says he sends $500 every two weeks to Mexico, where the oldest of his five children studies marketing in college. Back home, he says, he'd earn $4 a day.
Advocates who represent migrant workers say others aren't so lucky.
Gregory Scott Schell, a migrant workers' attorney in Florida, recently won a class-action suit on behalf of farmworkers who said they were cheated on their wages.
Many advocates are skeptical of plans to expand guest-worker programs. They say the programs create indentured servants.
"Workers are afraid they will not be asked back if they complain," says Mark Heller, a migrant workers' attorney in Toledo, Ohio.
There are other problems that worker rights advocates and growers say need to be resolved.
Worker abuses
Baldemar Velasquez, president of the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, says some of the worst abuses occur on the other side of the border, where workers are forced to pay off recruiters hired by U.S. companies. Mary Bauer, an attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center's Immigrant Justice Project, says the Guatemalan tree-cutters she is representing in a class-action suit had to give recruiters deeds to their homes.
Growers say they need a simpler application system and more federal workers to process applications. "Instead of putting money into building a fence across the border, they should be putting money into these programs and the agencies that run them," says Bernie Kohl, a Maryland nursery owner who hires about 130 guest workers a year.
Representatives at all three agencies involved -- the State Department, Labor Department and immigration -- say they have not yet calculated how many more employees they would need to handle the workload of an expanded guest-worker program.
At Willoway, Demaline says he'd recommend using guest workers, despite its difficulties. He also favors allowing foreign workers who are now here illegally to enroll in it, if only because he believes the alternative is unworkable.
"We couldn't get 1 million people out of New Orleans," he says, referring to Hurricane Katrina evacuation efforts. "How are we going to send 12 million Mexicans back?"

Giving visas to skilled workers bolsters economy

Next Monday marks the first day employers can apply for some of the 65,000 temporary  visas for highly skilled foreigners available for 2009. It may also be the last day.
The available number of so-called H-1B visas, which last six years, has always run short of demand. But last April, when applications for this year came in, they exceeded the limit on the first day they were accepted.
Pause for a moment to consider the implications of this. A program many high-tech companies consider crucial in filling their need for programmers, engineers and such, is so oversubscribed that it is turning into a once-a-year lottery. As Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates noted in recent congressional testimony, that can mean rescinding job offers to top recruits who can't get in.
The H-1B problem is one part of the highly skilled labor shortage the USA faces. So, too, is the lack of permanent visas for the best and brightest workers here on temporary visas, such as the H-1B and student visas, that are about to expire.
The problem is that too few Americans are going into scientific and technical fields. Meanwhile, general unease about immigration and globalization is holding up much-needed efforts to help U.S. companies that can't hire highly skilled workers for want of a visa.
This makes it harder for U.S. high-tech companies to compete. It also shows the effect the nation's anger and frustration over immigration and globalization can have in areas critical to the nation's future.
According to a study by the National Foundation for American Policy, a think tank on trade, immigration and education policy, the average high-tech company has 470 openings it can't fill. Microsoft tops the list with more than 4,000. Collectively the members of the Standard & Poor's 500 have 140,000 unfilled openings for highly skilled workers.
It's impossible to look at these numbers and not see a problem. President Bush and all three major presidential contenders see one and have expressed a desire to increase the number of H-1Bs awarded. And yet the efforts to raise the H-1B cap, as well as to provide more permanent visas to highly skilled workers, is being thwarted in Washington by labor and anti-immigration groups.
What's needed is obvious. The H-1B program should be both expanded and overhauled. Its critics rightly point out that it does not differentiate well between truly high-skilled workers and those who are merely in high demand. Valuable H-1B slots have gone to nurses' assistants, even chefs and models.
Beyond the H-1B program, more permanent visas need to be steered to highly skilled people. The obvious place to start is the 30,000 on temporary visas who get masters degrees, and 16,000 who get Ph.D.s, in science and engineering each year from American universities. These are some of the most desirable hires on the planet, and many have been financially supported by government and private foundations. And yet once they get their degrees, they are told to go home.
Some of the most ardent opposition comes from labor groups. Building on a hostility to immigration and globalization, they argue that employment-based immigration displaces U.S. workers and depresses wages.
Perhaps this is true for some jobs, but the case is much harder to make in high tech, where companies have vacancies they struggle for years to fill. It's also hard to make the case that we should be driving away some of the best tech talent in the world, effectively forcing those people to work for overseas competitors.

Infosys to hire 10,000 U.S. workers; 2,000 will be located at soon-to-open tech center in Indiana

Infosys, one of the Indian companies that's drawn unwanted attention for its business model of hiring Indian engineers on H-1B visas and outsourcing their lower-cost labor to U.S. firms, now wants to hire American.
On Tuesday,  it announced the opening of a 2,000-employee tech center in Indianapolis,  with another 8,000 jobs for American IT workers in coming years.
The deal comes with a strong dose of sweetener -- Indiana will give Infosys up to $31 million in conditional tax credits and training grants, the largest incentive package in the state's history.
The workers will mainly be computer scientists, engineers and programmers, CEO Vishal Sikka told USA TODAY.
The tech center will open in August. It will be fully staffed by 2021, and its workers will become part of Infosys' global integrated workforce, Sikka said.
"We're bringing in the best local talent and coupling that with the best global talent," he said.
Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb said he welcomed the company to the state's growing tech ecosystem.
"Our higher education institutions are producing a world-class workforce, establishing Indiana as the innovation hub of the Midwest. I look forward to working with Infosys to elevate Indiana to the next level," he said.
Infosys said it planned to open an additional three hubs around the U.S., focused on technology and innovation. Each will employ 2,000 workers and serve clients in industries including financial services, manufacturing, health care, retail and energy, and more. The company did not say where they planned to locate them or the time frame in which they will be hired.
The 10,000 total new U.S. workers would join Infosys' global workforce of 200,000. The company doesn't disclose how many work in which countries  or what percentage of its staff will be U.S.-based when the entire program is built out.
Infosys is an India-based information technology company that provides consulting and outsourcing services globally. Its headquarters are in India, but it has a U.S. office in Palo Alto, Calif., where Sikka is based.
It is one of the largest employers of H-1B visa holders in the United States, a program President Trump has railed against and vowed to end.
The visa program allows companies to hire foreigners in specialty occupations under three-year work visas that can be extended for another three years. A total of 85,000 are issued each year. Competition is fierce, and so many applications flood the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services each year that the window to apply typically lasts only a week. Under current rules, if companies pay holders more than $60,000 in salary, they do not need to prove there were no qualified Americans to fill the position.

Few highly skilled workers allowed in; Immigrants no threat to professionals in USA

Imagine what the immigration debate would look like if American doctors and lawyers had to compete for jobs with foreigners the way factory workers do.
While the least educated and least skilled Americans battle a constant stream of immigrants willing and able to do their jobs, the country's educated classes are insulated from such threats.
If foreign lawyers, doctors and accountants were free to work in the USA, consumers could save up to $270 billion a year, the Center for Economic and Policy Research says.
Foreign professionals have a much harder time getting into the USA  than foreign products. The only significant influx of talent from abroad has been for the technology industry, which can bring 65,000 skilled workers on H-1B visas.
Even at these low numbers, the affected American professionals sound a lot like factory workers who have been elbowed aside by low-wage immigrants. David Huber, a Chicago-based networking engineer who once earned a salary in the high six figures, blames the H-1B program for keeping him unemployed most of the past three years. "All these American citizens have lost tech jobs and the slots are filled up with H-1Bs," he complains.
High-tech companies, however, say they could use tens of thousands more foreign specialists each year because of a shortage of skilled computer pros. The March unemployment rate for workers with at least a college degree was just 2.2% vs. 7% for high-school dropouts, the Labor Department says.
James Goodnight, chief executive of privately held software firm SAS, says current immigration policy is cockeyed. The United States effectively allows in an unlimited number of unskilled people every year, worsening a surplus of such workers and driving down their wages. At the same time, Congress prevents tech companies from hiring as much of the world's best talent as they need.
"I want to hire the best and the brightest people," Goodnight says. "The current policies of the administration are to prevent that from happening."
SAS, based in Cary, N.C.,  has about 60 workers on H-1B visas. Among them is Sergiy Peredriy, 30, a Ukrainian who speaks four languages and is working on a Ph.D. in economics at the University of North Carolina. He works on projects to help retailers set product prices to maximize profits.
"What makes America strong is the constant influx of skilled smart people," he says. "As long as you keep that going, America is going to thrive. ... If the borders are closed, I think it will be very bad for this country."

Alberta has held job fairs in the USAtargetingimmigrants
CHANTILLY, Va. -- Fawad Rehman can't wait to show his adoptive country his entrepreneurial streak.
Rehman, an immigrant from Pakistan, plans to start a business school, similar to the one his family runs back home, and a construction business.
A big obstacle stands in the way, though: He doesn't know which country will adopt him, the United States or Canada.
Rehman, 29, an information technology consultant who lives in Columbia, Md., is in this country on a temporary H-1B visa, the kind issued to skilled workers for up to six years. He wants to become a permanent resident, but he isn't sure whether or when that will happen.
So, about a month ago, he applied to become a permanent resident in the province of Alberta, Canada, through a special program that fast-tracks applications from skilled immigrants in the U.S. If he qualifies, he could be approved in less than a year.
In the United States, that could take at least three years. And it's not a sure thing, because an employer must sponsor the worker.
"I want to start these businesses," Rehman says. "But I'm not trying here yet because I don't know if I will be here permanently."
At a time when the immigration debate in the U.S. is tied to national security and tightening borders, Alberta is urging immigrants to cross over and come north.
Since the Alberta government started recruiting immigrants in the USA in April, it has aggressively courted people such as Rehman, who are here on H-1 or E-3 visas for specialized work in technology, health care and other fields. Alberta needs to fill high-demand jobs, including pharmacists, iron workers and architects.
The province, which has a population of about 3.3 million, is experiencing explosive population and economic growth, particularly in oil and natural gas production. "It's virtually full employment in Alberta," says Gary Mar, Alberta's official representative to the United States.
Skilled immigrants in the USA are attractive because they have North American work experience, know the culture, speak English and assimilate quickly, he says.
In the U.S., the federal government handles immigration. In Canada, provinces have some authority for the skilled workers they recruit, says Wendy Blackwell of Alberta's Ministry of Employment and Immigration.
On Monday, Alberta immigration officials held an information session for about 200 immigrants at the Canadian Embassy in Washington. They were at an area job fair here Tuesday and planned to attend one in Maryland today. They have traveled to Houston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Palo Alto, Calif., and will be in New York City next month.
So far, about 500 people have submitted initial applications for permanent residency, Blackwell says.
The program appeals to skilled immigrants who are frustrated with the U.S. immigration system, she says. Getting permanent status here can take years, and some immigrants complain because their spouses aren't allowed to work.
Alberta's program grants eligible applicants and their families permanent residency in six to 12 months and allows spouses to work. Those interested don't need to secure a job before applying.
"People say it's so difficult for them here," she says. "The people who have been coming to see us have been the well-educated, people that are concerned about the way the U.S. economy is going, people that really want to start looking at other options."
Saskatchewan, the province east of Alberta, also is growing rapidly and needs workers, says Rob Norris, the minister responsible for immigration. It, too, is considering recruiting skilled immigrants in the USA, he says.
Jeff Lande is senior vice president at the Information Technology Association of America, a trade group that lobbies for more visas for skilled workers and legal permanent residents, known as green-card holders.
He believes most immigrants aren't leaving willingly. "If they have the option of staying in America, where they have established roots and jobs and contacts, chances are they would," he says. "Because they cannot get that green card, they look at options elsewhere."
Peter Njoroge, 26, visited Alberta's booth at the job fair. He came to the USA from Kenya as a refugee in 2001 and says he's upset by the pace of the immigration process. He's not eligible for Alberta's program because he's not on a skilled-worker visa, but Blackwell says people like him might get temporary-worker visas that could lead to permanent residency.
"I love the U.S.," he says, "but if it means my life's going to get better by living in Canada and getting the process taken care of, I'll definitely look into it."

Small businesses borrowing at slower rate; Uncertainty over Trump's agenda gets some of the blame

Small businesses are still basking in the afterglow of President Trump's upset victory in the 2016 election, and they're bullish about his proposed tax cuts and health care changes, surveys show.
So why aren't they borrowing money?
Various indicators show U.S. companies, particularly small firms, have been taking out fewer loans in recent months, a sign they're spending less on new equipment and structures. And that can crimp economic growth and hiring.
Experts cite a variety of reasons, including uncertainty over Trump's agenda getting through Congress amid probes into his ties with Russia.
"Businesses are just wanting clarity before putting these investments to work," said Stephen Caprio, U.S. credit strategist for UBS.
Rishi Khanna, CEO of ISHIR, a Dallas-based software consulting firm, said several projects have been delayed, in part because of Trump's plan to reduce the number of H-1B visas, which affects technology workers he assigns to clients. Some clients, he said, are also holding back because of uncertainty over Trump's agenda.
As a result, Khanna has deferred plans to borrow several hundred thousand dollars for new computer hardware and software amid a 10% to 15% drop in revenue from a year ago.
"Customers are taking baby steps," he said. "It is a bit frustrating."
Experts point to other culprits for the lending slump: a flurry of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes that boost borrowing costs for some, and a retreat after some small firms took out too many expensive loans.
Some economists downplay the drop in lending, attributing it to an earlier decline in investment, especially among energy companies. But Caprio said energy firms represented just a small slice of the market.
In the first quarter, loans to non-financial U.S. businesses rose about 3% from a year earlier, compared with 10% annual growth in the first half of 2016, UBS figures show. Small businesses appear to be more cautious. Bond issuance -- effectively a loan funded by financial markets -- by larger companies increased 2% in the January-March period from the fourth quarter while loans by small firms edged up just 0.3%, according to UBS.
The trend hasn't reversed recently. Twenty-eight percent of small businesses said they had borrowed at least once every three months in May, down from 31% the prior month and the lowest since October, according to the latest survey by the National Federation of Independent Business. The portion planning to make a capital expenditure in the months ahead edged up to 28%, still below pre-recession levels.
While small business optimism is still near record levels, many are "trying to see how (Trump's plan) plays out" before borrowing, said Holly Wade, NFIB research director.
Loan applications to Biz2Credit, which connects thousands of small business borrowers to lenders online, fell 0.5% in May following a 2.5% decline in April, said Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora. That marked the first time in two years loan applications dropped two consecutive months, he said.
"Businesses were expecting health care reform and tax reform to come in," he added. "Expectations ran ahead of reality."
Arora and Caprio also partly blamed three Fed rate hikes since December. Arora said the increases quickly translate into higher borrowing costs for small businesses with lines of credit or Small Business Administration-backed loans. Thirty-one percent of companies surveyed by UBS said they would slow capital spending if rates increased by less than 1%.
Many small concerns have turned to alternative online lenders that have easier credit standards but charge higher interest rates and require payback in six months to a year, said Ami Kassar, CEO of MultiFunding, a loan adviser for small businesses. Some struggle to keep up with the payments and  take out additional loans, digging a deeper hole for themselves. In recent months, several have stopped borrowing because they went bankrupt, he said.
Others are simply responding to softer demand.
Raja Jhanjee, owner of Bukhara Grill in Manhattan, said business is down 15% to 20% from a year ago. He points to fewer international visitors as a result of fears sparked by Trump's immigration crackdown. And so he's holding off on seeking a loan to open a new restaurant.
"You have to wait and watch," he said.

Plight of 'legal' immigrants lost in debate

Recent Senate discussions and news reports regarding immigration are very disheartening and perplexing to us "legals" ("Historic rallies voice a 'dream'," News, Tuesday).
For the past two weeks, all we have heard about are the proposed "rights" of the illegal immigrants who are marching through the streets. Well, excuse me, but what about the rights of the legal immigrants?
They are the millions of people who entered the USA legally, have work permits, are professionals or have been sponsored by family members. They are the people whose applications languish because of red tape and extremely long processing delays.
They are the people who require employer letters, work permits, TN visas, H1B permits, labor certification, state wage board approval and so on through the bureaucratic maze. They are the people who have to hire attorneys at thousands of dollars to help them interpret and file required forms.
It is all of us legal immigrants who should be protesting. Our rights -- those of the people who are caught up in the quagmire of immigration applications -- should also be considered.
A case in point is my grandfather's experience. He came to the USA in 1939 and was entitled to U.S. citizenship but did not obtain it because of the government's misfiling of his application for more than six years.
And what about my ability to claim my U.S. citizenship through him? Our rights were not protected.
How many thousands of similar cases are out there for which no one speaks up?
But, oh yes, let's not forget about the rights of those who sneaked across the border.
Kris Kaszuba
Point Roberts, Wash.
Illegals are lawbreakers
I am in favor of immigration, but immigration is a legal process associated with entering a country. What we're being forced to consider is not immigration. It is surreptitious entry.
In recent weeks, we have been fed a steady stream of misinformation that characterizes proposed legislation as the "criminalization" of as many as 12 million people. That is patently false. People who are here illegally are already criminals by virtue of their method of entry into this country; we already have laws in place that make that distinction. The very fact that they are called "illegals," even in the migrant community, is a recognition of this fact. And yet, we hear many elected officials trying to rationalize acceptance of a lower standard.
Our laws provide for legal migration into our country. Our laws provide expedited entry for those fleeing political and religious persecution. That is compassionate and charitable.
But, as the saying goes, charity begins at home. Forcing legal Americans to continue to underwrite hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of medical, educational and social assistance for illegals who, contrary to the current line of misinformation, have not paid taxes on the funds they shipped back to their home country is not compassionate. It is insanity.
The bottom line: Illegals are not pilgrims, as some have tried to characterize them. They are just illegal.
Doug Kuiphoff
Grand Rapids, Mich.
Immigrants' contribution
It is morally wrong to call people who come here to work "burglars," as one recent letter to the editor did, because the majority of these illegal immigrants take work that nobody likes to do ("'We are a nation of laws'," Monday).
Most opponents of illegal immigration are those who have always worked in the comfort of a climate-controlled environment. They should stop to think a little about how they get their produce at the supermarket: most likely, via illegal immigrants laboring under the searing sun for more than 10 hours and making minimum wage or less.
Let's put hypocrisy aside and admit that just a handful of Americans would work in the fields even if the wages were tripled, not to mention we'd also have to pay three times the current price for a pound of fruit or vegetables so farmers could cover the increase in salaries.
Instead of being so critical, opponents should try to find a realistic solution. Labeling people is easy, but it doesn't help.
Marco Antonio Cruz
Chicago
'Politics as usual'
There are powerful and convincing arguments on both sides of the illegal immigration issue. Too bad we don't have the wisdom of Solomon. The only thing most reasonable people, including members of Congress, agree on is the need to secure U.S. borders to safeguard against terrorists and criminals. After that, it's self-interest and ideology that polarize the debate.
Those who support the illegal immigrants argue that the USA needs these workers. They also point to their children, who are now U.S. citizens. This draws upon our sympathies and presents a real dilemma.
Those who are against the illegal immigrants base their position on the rule of law. How often have we heard, "We can't reward people for breaking the law"?
Whether we like it or not, the reality is that illegal immigrants are here in big numbers and are important to many segments of our economy. That trumps the practicality of current law.
At the end of the day, the jockeying in Washington by both political parties to change the law is simply to see which position will be viewed most favorably by Spanish-speaking voters. I'm afraid it's politics as usual -- and illegal immigrants will continue to pour across our southern border regardless of barriers we might spend billions of dollars to erect.
Bob Routsong
St. George, Utah
Legal entry is OK
While the USA is a nation of immigrants, it is a country of legal immigrants.
I do not subscribe to the theme that illegal immigrants want to take only the low-paying jobs. The last time I checked, a number of our good-paying jobs went south of the border.
Illegal immigration is wrong. I do not want to pick up the tab for food, medicine and shelter for a group that enters the country illegally.
I embrace those who come to our country legally. That is how my forefathers came: legally.
Don Gillies
Evansville, Ind.
Come, but learn English
I don't have any problem with our "guests" from other countries. I think the mixture of cultures is beneficial for this country. I do have a problem, however, with the people in this area who have been here for many years who refuse to learn English.
If people want to be in this country so badly, they need to assimilate and become "American." This means following laws, being good citizens and speaking English.
If I went to Mexico City and decided to stay there, city residents would not switch to speaking English for me. I would be expected to learn Spanish.
Yes, come to America -- but learn the language.
D. Ezell

Opportunity knocks in Canada; Alberta hits U.S. job fairs to lure immigrants with faster path to permanent residency status

CHANTILLY, Va. -- Fawad Rehman can't wait to show his adoptive country his entrepreneurial streak.
Rehman, an immigrant from Pakistan, plans to start a business school, similar to the one his family runs back home, and a construction business. A big obstacle stands in the way, though: He doesn't know which country will adopt him, the USA or Canada.
Rehman, 29, an information technology consultant who lives in Columbia, Md., is in this country on a temporary H-1B visa, the kind issued to skilled workers for up to six years. He wants to become a permanent resident, but he isn't sure whether or when that will happen.

Tech leaders, Trump work to warm frosty relations; President's comments under- score what has been a relation- ship tinged with tension

As he surveyed a room of 18 tech executives whose companies are worth trillions of dollars, Donald Trump couldn't resist.
"We have approximately $3.5 trillion of market value in this room. But that is almost the exact number we have created (through stock market gains) since my election," he  told Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and others who gathered Monday at the White House to discuss how the federal government can make better use of technology. "In fact, I think we have you beat by a little bit, which is a pretty good number. But I congratulate you all on an amazing job."
And with that classic opener from Trump -- correct in the stock gains, if not precisely all the reasons -- began what may be a thaw in recently frosty relations between the tech industry and the White House.
Tech stocks have indeed been on a tear, leading the stock market to record highs and ballooning the personal wealth of attendees such as Bezos, now the second-wealthiest man in the world. Amazon shares passed $1,000 in May, Google parent Alphabet accomplished the same feat this month, and Apple passed $800 billion in market value, a record, in May.
The Wilshire 5000, the broad gauge of the stock market, has added $3.6 trillion since election day on Nov. 8, 2016, a byproduct of several factors, economists and professional investors say, including early hopes of a fiscal stimulus from Trump's election, a rebounding global economy and strong first-quarter earnings.
Against this sunny backdrop, the new administration's policies have cast a pall on the tech industry. The president and Silicon Valley differ sharply on immigration, offshoring of jobs, encryption and H-1B work visas. But the two sides could find common ground on taxation, deregulation, and apprenticeship programs and job training.
Early Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn met with 10 tech industry group leaders at the White House. Mnunchin said the administration's objective with tax reform is lower corporate tax rates and a simplified individual tax system.
The goal is to make it easier for U.S.-based companies to bring revenues generated overseas back to the U.S. with less of a penalty than they face currently, Mnuchin said.
"We are committed to getting this done and getting it done quickly," he said. "Our objective is to simplify the system ... and bring back trillions of dollars."
That will increase investment and "create jobs in our country," Mnuchin said. The administration wants to have a tax plan that's agreed upon by the White House and Congress by the first weeks of September. Yet details remain sketchy, and some Republican congressmen from high-tax states such as California, New York and Illinois have voiced opposition.
Monday's meeting of tech's biggest names -- 18 executives, including the leaders of IBM, Oracle, SAP and Intel, attended -- kicked off tech week in Washington, D.C. During the session's sit-down, among other things, Bezos says it was "impossible to overstate" the importance of artificial intelligence, and Trump vowed "stronger protection against cyber attacks." Separately, Cook brought up the importance of immigration, though it remained unclear what was specifically discussed.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer, in his Tuesday briefing, said the president will visit Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Wednesday to observe "innovations in agriculture" at Kirkwood Community College.
Thursday, Trump will be treated to demos of drones and universal broadband, according to Spicer.
The administration's emphasis on tech, and its growing influence on the U.S. economy, is "largely symbolic, but symbols are important in politics," says Sarah Bonk, a former Apple senior design manager who is co-founder and chief strategy officer at DisruptDC, a non-partisan, non-profit coalition for better government and elections based in Washington, D.C.
"There are opportunities, as there were during the Obama administration, to create a more sane tax policy and address the jobs and skills gaps," she says.

Demand has dropped for visas that bring foreigners to the USA for jobs at software companies, hospitals and other workplaces.
Since the annual application period began April 1, Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) has received 45,000 applications for H-1B visas, those issued to workers with special skills for up to six years. That's 20,000 fewer than the yearly cap of 65,000.
In the past two years, all 65,000 spots were snapped up within two days.
"It's because the economy's tanking," says Carl Shusterman, a Los Angeles immigration attorney whose office prepared about 40 applications this year, half of what it did last year. H-1B applications are submitted by employers, and many are doing less hiring, he says.
In addition to the 65,000, there's a separate cap of 20,000 for foreign workers with advanced degrees from U.S. institutions. That has nearly been met, says CIS spokeswoman Chris Rhatigan.
Robert Hoffman, vice president for government relations of software maker Oracle, says demand for the visas tracks the economy. Hoffman is co-chair of Compete America, a coalition of employers and others that promotes policies that allow skilled foreigners to work here.
As industries such as biotechnology and renewable energy boomed this decade, so did their need for skilled workers, he says. In the past two years, anticipating stiff competition, "there was a rush to get applications in as early as possible," he says.
Like many other companies, however, Oracle applied for fewer H-1B visas this year than it did last year, says Hoffman, who says it was related to the economy but declines to give specifics.
Rhatigan says the slower pace reflects normal fluctuations in applications.
She points to 2006, when it took 56 days to meet the 65,000 cap -- more than twice as fast as the year before. Figures from 2000 to 2008, though, show accelerating interest in applications.
Critics of H-1B visas include the Programmers Guild, a professional organization for computer programmers. The guild argues that H-1B visas allow companies to get rid of Americans and hire lower-paid foreign workers.
Last week, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois introduced a bill that Grassley says would require employers to try to recruit Americans first, including advertising on a new Labor Department website.
Grassley says that's especially important in the sagging economy. "We want people to be able to employ people to get the job done," he says, "but it should be when there aren't enough American workers here."

The U.S. will allow 15,000 extra temporary worker visas this year

Despite President Trump's vow to put American workers first, the administration on Monday announced that it will allow an additional 15,000 low-wage, seasonal workers into the United States during the remainder of the fiscal year.
The H-2B visas are designed for non-agricultural workers for jobs in a variety of businesses, including fisheries, construction, hotels, restaurants and resorts. The Trump Organization is among the firms that use the visas, including workers at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.
The United States grants up to 33,000 such visas every six months, meaning the additional visas will provide a 45% increase for the second half of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
Trump's "America First" strategy resonated with his populist base throughout the campaign, and it became a central component of his domestic agenda as president.
On Monday, Trump announced the establishment of the first "Made in America" day to honor American workers and job creators. "American work ethic and quality craftsmanship are the heart and soul of our nation," read a statement from Trump.
In April, he ordered his agencies to change the H-1B visa program, which is used by technology companies to recruit highly educated foreign workers. At the time, Trump said the program was being abused to import cheaper foreign workers who undercut the wages of American workers.
That argument explains why some supporters of Trump's immigration policies were shocked by Monday's seeming reversal.
Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of immigration, said American workers are just starting to see the benefits of Trump's restrictive immigration policies, including higher salaries because they have fewer foreign workers to compete against. The new visas, he said, would halt that progress.
"This is yet another example of the administration and Congress failing to keep the Trump campaign promise of putting American workers first," Beck said.
The Department of Homeland Security challenged that assessment, arguing additional foreign workers are needed to save American companies that can't find enough labor and could go out of business without the help.
"We're talking about American businesses that are at risk of suffering irreparable harm if they don't get additional H-2B workers, so we do think that fits into the 'America first' focus of the administration," Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told reporters Monday.
The visa expansion was first approved by Congress, which authorized the administration to add up to 70,000 H-2B visas. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., helped lead the charge and applauded Monday's announcement.
"As President Trump has noted, the H-2B program is vital for businesses that desperately need temporary help to keep their doors open and keep their American workforce employed," Tillis said.
Homeland Security said it would post the official notice of the additional visas in the Federal Register this week.

One of President Obama's highest policy priorities is making America energy independent. The president has correctly observed that our reliance on others for essential energy needs is both a source of weakness and an impediment to the development of new technologies that would also strengthen our economy and help the environment.
In much the same way that we have avoided investing in domestic energy sources and new technologies, we have developed an unhealthy reliance on foreign workers to fill our science and technology needs. As technology has become increasingly important to our economy, U.S. companies have spent millions of dollars lobbying for increased access to foreign workers, rather than investing in American workers to fill jobs.
Despite more than 84,000 high-tech layoffs in the first quarter of 2009, by late April, U.S. employers had filed more than 45,000 new petitions to hire foreign workers, under what's known as the H-1B visa program, instead of investing in training and developing American workers. Worse yet,current law allows American workers to be replaced with new H-1B workers.
The free flow of these workers creates a disincentive to America's own best and brightest to train for many of the jobs that are critical to our economic future. Depressing wages by increasing the labor pool of high-tech workers often directs our most talented people to other professions.
Besides depressing opportunities for American workers, importing large numbers of H-1B workers forestalls the urgent need to recruit and train American workers for the jobs of the future. Instead of perpetuating this dependency through ever-larger H-1B quotas, our nation would be better served by making a commitment to cultivate the talents of our own current and future workers.
The original purpose of the H-1B program was to give our nation access to a small number of people who possessed unique skills, and whose presence here would complement our own labor force. We need to get back to that original intent. What America needs is public and private investment in our people, not a convenient substitute for a well-trained domestic labor force.
Dan Stein is president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates reducing legal immigration levels and strict legal-immigration enforcement.

Around this time each year, thousands of foreign students graduate with science and engineering degrees from U.S. universities. Many are eager to stay in America and contribute to the U.S. economy.
So does the United States welcome them with open arms? No, the government tells thousands of them to hit the road -- and take their sought-after skills and brainpower to countries and companies that compete with the USA.
Talk about a self-defeating immigration policy.
Mind you, these immigrants are not seeking to sneak across the border and stay here illegally. They are educated students, many with professional or masters' degrees or doctorates, who want to play by the rules. U.S. companies want to hire them. But they get painted with the same broad anti-immigration brush that Congress has used to make the nation's legal immigration system a morass of quotas, caps and unconscionable waits.
For years, Congress has limited the number of highly skilled foreign workers whom U.S. companies can hire under what's known as the H-1B program. Every April 1, companies -- from high-tech to financial firms -- file petitions to hire these individuals.
In recent years, the cap of 85,000 (including 20,000 set aside for those with advanced degrees from U.S. institutions) has been reached within days, sometimes the first day. Last year, about 78,000 of the best and brightest didn't make the cut.
High-tech companies, such as Microsoft and Oracle, have long lobbied to eliminate this counterproductive system. This month, they gained a powerful ally, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
"Our immigration laws discriminate pretty heavily against highly talented scientists and engineers who want to come to this country and be part of our technological establishment," Bernanke told a congressional panel. By opening doors to more people with top technical skills, he predicted, "you'd keep companies here, and you'd have more innovation here, and you'd have more growth here."
Instead, Congress has been moved by labor leaders and others who argue that foreign workers take jobs from Americans, work for lower salaries and push down wages. These arguments sidestep a number of facts, including the nature of the free market.
In some U.S. graduate programs, foreign students simply outnumber Americans. In 2006, more than 58% of graduate students in computer sciences were foreign, and so were more than 68% in electrical engineering, according to the National Science Foundation. To shun them is to ignore a huge resource.
When companies can't hire the talent they need at home, they go elsewhere. In 2007, Microsoft, for one, expanded from its home in Redmond, Wash., into Vancouver and did its hiring in Canada.
Because of the recession, this is the first spring in years that visas haven't been snapped up at a breakneck pace. Even in this tough year, though, 45,000 are already gone.
The respite marks a good time for Congress to reassess and make the system flexible enough to meet employer needs. The current policy makes no sense. It turns away talent educated at top universities, often subsidized by U.S. taxpayers, at the very moment the nation needs all the smarts and innovation it can muster.

Why not assess a tax on employers for each worker who holds an  H-1B visa. The amount could be based on two times  the worker's gross wages and benefits for the duration of the visa. An adjustment could be made for any pay rate changes before the visa is  renewed. These funds would go 100% into grants for legal U.S. residents  to pursue graduate work in the  areas of higher education that are in demand and that these visa holders are filling ("Congratulations, graduate. Now leave the USA.," Our view, Legal immigration debate, May 12).
Allow the employers to propose the skill areas that they claim are in short supply so training can be targeted to  their needs.  If  other countries can anticipate these needs and train their citizens, then surely we can do the same.
This  also would remove the criticism that  the H-1B program is just a back door to cheap labor.

H-1B visa has side effects
The H-1B visa program was never intended to result in the replacement of the training and development of American high-tech workers. As implemented, however, it has contributed to the decline in the U.S. economy and an increase in the U.S. unemployment rate.
Stop parading around the song and dance of Microsoft and Oracle  executives who have lobbied to eliminate the cap on these skilled workers. They are only interested in getting cheap, high-tech labor and are willing to sacrifice the interests of the very country that made their tremendous success possible  to achieve that goal.

A true 'clunker'
I mentioned  the  proposal to give vouchers of up to $4,500 to people for trading in gas-guzzlers to some friends. All had the same response: The dealers will just jack up prices $4,500, and the consumer will still lose   ("Put the brakes on 'cash for clunkers,' " Our view, Vehicle vouchers debate, Wednesday).
Why can't the government make a program that is simple  and benefits all the people who are hurting in this bad economy. This  program would benefit only a few.  Think about it: Those with clunkers probably can't afford a new car  right now anyway. This proposal makes me shudder to think what  a government-run health care program would be like.

Trend on pitchers
The Major League Baseball trend of carrying 12 or more pitchers has changed the game for the worse ("Plenty of pitchers populate rosters," Sports, Wednesday).
Instead of watching two stellar starting pitchers duel until possibly the  ninth inning, when the ace closer would be brought in to shut down a potential rally, we now see what used to be called "mop-up men" parading in from the sixth inning on.
USA TODAY's article noted that "relievers have been woeful this season,"  blown saves are on the rise and bullpen ERAs are ballooning. Is there any wonder? These two or three extra pitchers on each roster are pitchers who'd still be in the minor leagues back in the glory days of baseball.

It wasn't the U.S. economy that convinced Tao Guo to leave the USA. It was the Chinese economy.
After 24 years in the United States, the 46-year-old naturalized citizen moved to Shanghai in December to take a high-level position at WuXi AppTec, which does research for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
He's among a growing number of highly skilled immigrants who are leaving the USA to take jobs in their native countries, particularly India and China. The International Monetary Fund projects that China's gross domestic product will grow by 7.5% this year and India's by 5.4%. In the USA, the GDP is projected to contract by 2.6%.
"They see much more promise in the economic future of those countries," says Charles Hsu of Bay City Capital in San Francisco. "There's also a chance for them to move ahead much more rapidly in their careers."
At WuXi, 80% to 90% of senior managers returned to China from other countries, mostly the USA, says Rich Soll, vice president of medicinal chemistry.
"I have much bigger responsibility than I used to have," says Guo, the company's executive director of chemistry. Previously, he was director of chemistry for a pharmaceutical firm in New Jersey.
His wife and teenage children remain in the USA. He visits but plans to keep working in China. "It's more challenging," he says. "It's more rewarding."
Other skilled immigrants don't want to leave but say immigration-related delays give them no choice.
Nil Dutta, 37, came to the USA in 1999 on a student visa and after getting two master's degrees at the University of Michigan, he took a job at a European software company with offices here. He now has an H-1B visa for skilled workers.
Dutta, who lives in Hampton Roads, Va., applied for legal permanent residency, also called "green card" status, in 2004 and most likely still faces years of waiting. The government is just now processing applications made in his category on or before April 15, 2001.
A maximum of 140,000 green cards are awarded on employment-based visas each year, and that quota is divided into categories for classes of workers and a set percentage for each country.
Applicants from India and China face especially long waits because more of them apply, says Bill Hing, law professor at the University of California-Davis. "Since there are more applicants than visas available each year, there's a carry-over to the next year," he says.
Dutta says the wait is wearing on him. Visa rules limit his family's travel, he says, and his ability to get a promotion.
He's considering returning to India, where he has two job offers. He says he's likely to make the move in the spring.
"I had a lot of enthusiasm and was very eager to work for this country. It's all fizzled out. It seems I'm not wanted," Dutta says. "In 10 to 15 years, I could be much better off in terms of position as well as money in India."

Schools with Turkish ties draw interest; Some question hiring, objectives at charters

They have  generic, forward-sounding names like Horizon Science Academy, Pioneer Charter School of Science and Beehive Science & Technology Academy.
Quietly established over the past decade by a loosely affiliated group of Turkish-American educators, these 100 or so publicly funded charter schools in 25 states are often among the top-performing public schools in their towns.
The schools educate as many as 35,000 students -- taken together they'd make up the largest charter school network in the USA -- and have imported thousands of Turkish educators over the past decade.
But the success of the schools at times has been clouded by nagging questions about what ties the schools may have to a reclusive  Muslim leader in his late 60s living in exile in rural Pennsylvania.
Described by turns as a moderate Turkish nationalist, a peacemaker and "contemporary Islam's Billy Graham," Fethullah Gulen has long pushed for Islam to occupy a more central role in Turkish society. Followers of  the so-called Gulen Movement operate an "education, media and business network" in more than 100 countries, says University of Oregon sociologist Joshua Hendrick.
Top administrators say they have no official ties to Gulen. And Gulen himself denies any connection to the schools. Still,  documents available at various foundation websites and in federal forms required of  non-profit groups  show that virtually all of the schools have opened or operate with the aid of Gulen-inspired "dialogue" groups, local non-profits that promote Turkish culture. In one case, the Ohio-based Horizon Science Academy of Springfield in 2005 signed a five-year building lease with  the parent organization of Chicago's Niagara Foundation, which promotes Gulen's philosophy  of "peace, mutual respect, the culture of coexistence." Gulen is the foundation's honorary president. In many cases, charter school board members also serve as  dialogue group leaders.
Education officials who are familiar with them say the  schools aren't trying to proselytize for Gulen's vision of Turkey.  While Turkish language and culture are often offered in the curriculum,  there's no evidence the schools teach Islam.
Nelson Smith, president of the National Alliance of Public Charter Schools, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, sees no evidence of an "active network. What I do see is a really impressive group of educators."
The Turkish-affiliated schools focus on math and science and often appear as top scorers on standardized tests. Still, lawmakers,  researchers and parents are beginning to put the schools under the microscope for   hiring practices -- they import hundreds of teachers from Turkey each year -- and for steps they take to keep their academic profile high.
The schools' unacknowledged ties to Gulen, they say, mock public schools' spirit of transparency.
"That's what I was always asking for," says Kelly Wayment, a former board member and parent at Beehive Science & Technology Academy in Holladay, Utah. He has pressed for more than a year to get the school to acknowledge ties to Gulen. "I said, 'Parents have a right to know.' "
Wayment says Beehive removed him from the board last year after he began investigating  the decision to fire a popular Spanish teacher, saying it was based on a single classroom visit by the Tustin, Calif.-based Accord Institute of Education Research, an education services company with ties to  a chain of California  charter schools inspired by Gulen.  He complained to Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican lawmaker, who launched an  audit of charter school governance  -- the audit is ongoing.
But Beehive's Karlene Welker says Wayment "removed himself (from the board) by pulling his students out of the school."
Utah's State Charter School Board launched an investigation last year after American teachers complained that Turkish colleagues got hiring and promotion preferences.
The charter school board looked into Beehive's ties to Islam and found them "circumstantial," but a financial probe found that the school was $337,000 in the red -- and that Accord officials had loaned it thousands. The board last April revoked its charter, but in June voted to keep the school open on probation.
Dunnigan, the state lawmaker who requested the legislative audit, says the financial details, such as personal loans and public funds spent recruiting overseas faculty, are what concern him. "When they're in such financial difficulty, should they spend $53,000 to bring these people over from another country?"
But questions about hiring and academics also have arisen in Arizona, where Daisy Education Corp. runs five schools and has received certifications for 120 H-1B visas for foreign teachers since 2002, records show. In Texas, the  Cosmos Foundation has filed 1,157 H1-B applications since 2001. It operates 25 Harmony schools statewide. Since 2001, Harmony has imported 731 employees using H-1Bs, surpassing all other secondary education providers nationwide. Parents last year also accused one Harmony school of "pushing out" underperforming students -- a charge the Texas Education Agency confirmed.
Ed Fuller, a University of Texas-Austin researcher, found that Harmony schools throughout Texas had an "extraordinarily high" student attrition rate of about 50% for students in grades six through eight.
"It's not hard to be 'exemplary' if you lose all the kids who aren't performing," Fuller says.
Crossing the line?
At minimum, the rapid growth of the Turkish-affiliated schools shows how the freewheeling world of charter schools has changed the face of K-12 education in the USA.
In most cases, charters are loosely regulated in exchange for improved performance.  A few schools are affiliated with religious groups or offer programs that others can't. But in several cases, a school's orientation has forced it to show that it's not crossing lines and endorsing religion.  Examples:
*Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy, a Minnesota charter school authorized by Islamic Relief USA, a Virginia-based aid group. In 2008, the school ran afoul of state officials who said having teachers take part in voluntary Friday prayers could give students the impression that the school endorsed Islam.
*Sacramento City Unified School District in California, which for 12 years has fought a lawsuit that says the city's Waldorf schools are based on the religious beliefs of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner.
Whether such  schools  continue to grow is no small question, since President Obama has made charter school expansion a priority.
While the Turkish-affiliated schools disavow any connection to the Gulen Movement, Gulen himself maintains in legal filings that he's the inspiration behind their growth. But William Martin of Rice University in Houston says educators' assertions of "no organic connection" to Gulen are accurate.
Nonetheless, he says their efforts to minimize ties to Gulen, likely from fear of being branded Islamists, bring "unnecessary and probably counterproductive" suspicion. "I do not think they are a sinister organization."
In an e-mail interview, Mehmet Argin, principal of Tucson's Sonoran Science Academy, says his school's parent corporation, Daisy Education Corp., "has no legal or organic ties" with other schools. He cautions against linking charter schools founded by Turkish-Americans directly to the Gulen Movement "just because Turkish-Americans may be inspired by Mr. Gulen."
In an e-mail interview, Gulen denied any direct connection to these schools, rejecting the notion that there is a "Gulen Movement," but acknowledging there may be educators now in U.S. schools who have listened to his philosophy. "I have no relation with any institution in the form of ownership, board membership or any similar kind," he said.
A 'third force'
Gulen  has pushed for more dialogue between the Western and Muslim worlds, yet he  is a controversial figure in Turkey.
The University of Oregon's  Hendrick, whose writings explore the Gulen Movement, calls him "Turkey's most famous religious personality." His movement is considered the nation's "third force" alongside the military and Turkey's ruling Adalet ve Kalkynma Partisi, or AKP Party.
In 1999, after traveling to the USA for medical treatment, Gulen was charged in Turkey with trying to create an Islamic state. Since then he has remained in Pennsylvania. After the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service in 2007 denied his bid for a visa as an "alien of extraordinary ability in education," Gulen sued,  saying his followers "had established more than 600 educational institutions" worldwide. He eventually prevailed, earning a green card in 2008. But Turkish educators in the USA continue to disavow their ties.
"Gulen is both the reason behind his schools, and he has nothing whatsoever to do with them," Hendrick says.

I read with interest  commentary writer Katrina Trinko's  Forum piece about a proposal to grant visas to international entrepreneurs intending to hire several workers with $250,000 in funds from a U.S. investor ("Create jobs by bringing in immigrants," Tuesday).
As a British legal immigrant invited to the USA in 2001 to work as a regional manager, I have an  H-1B visa, which was initially for  three years and extended to  six years.  Because of the inefficiency of the  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, my whole family is still waiting patiently in line for permanent residency approval, with  an additional extension, until 2012.
One of the many key points  Trinko highlighted was the cost of filing fees. I would like to add, as someone with personal experience, that her suggestion of $6,000 for an H-1B for  six years is way off the mark. She fails to point out the cost of additional work permits, extensions,  non-working visas for family members, and the cost of appeals when the  immigration bureau denies approval of visas. To date, for myself and my family of  four, we have spent nearly $42,000  to  live legally in the United States. We also have contributed  federal and state taxes for the  past nine years.
With the  debates about the DREAM Act in Congress, H-1B legal resident immigrants are  left out and yet continue to provide a healthy revenue stream to the federal government. For many of us, our dream has become a nightmare.

Invest in U.S. citizens
With unemployment close to 10%,  why don't U.S. investors with $250,000 consider helping out-of-work American citizens instead of backing a foreign entrepreneur? How is this country ever going to get back on track if we don't stop sending jobs overseas and then bringing in immigrants to invest in?
The Republicans  have said that the rich shouldn't be  forced to give up their tax cuts because they are the ones who provide jobs.
How's that been going for the past decade during which they have enjoyed paying less in taxes while  increasing their own wealth?

Should 'illegal,' bright high-schoolers get the boot?; I teach many undocumented immigrants. Here's why we should give them a path to citizenship.

A couple of weeks ago, I was sitting with one of my 12th-grade English students at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va., helping her edit an essay for a nursing program to which she was applying. Suddenly a sentence leaped out at me: "I am illegal." When I told this bright, totally Americanized girl that I was surprised, she replied: "There are a lot of us here." I didn't have the heart to tell her -- which is why she shall remain nameless -- that perhaps she shouldn't mention this fact in her application.
Over the years, I have taught hundreds of Latino kids and naively assumed they were all legal immigrants. Or for that matter, the many Asian, African and Middle Eastern students I have taught.  But several staff members who work closely with immigrant students estimate that as many as 60% of our Latino students alone -- that is more than 300 kids -- might be illegal.
In my classroom
My high school is only about a half-hour drive from the U.S. Capitol, where legislators wage divisive battles over what do to about illegal immigrants. But those lawmakers do not see what I see. When I scan my classroom, I see only the diverse faces of my students -- but I couldn't tell you who is here legally or who isn't. Nor do I care. And apparently neither does our educational system, which is as it should be.
Why else would federal law forbid a school district from denying a free public education to undocumented children who reside within that district or forbid schools from disclosing any information about a child's immigration status to the Citizenship and Immigration Services?  The federal government understands that it is in the country's best interest to give these children access to a free public elementary and secondary education.
But why do we stop there?
We are in essence kicking these young people out of America at the point when they have the potential to become more productive members of our society.
I understand that many Americans see these students as lawbreakers. But like their parents, these students have already been in the USA for years and have no plans to leave.
Rather than consigning these young people to lives in the shadows, unable to vote, to attend a four-year state college, to enter the military  or to get anything but the lowest-paying jobs that do not require a Social Security number, we need to come up with an innovative way to put them on a path to citizenship. And not only for their sake, but also for our own.
If you listen closely enough, you will hear in these students' stories the very same fears and hopes felt by many of the immigrants who preceded them to this country:
"I feel caged in. ... I am not allowed to reach for what I want. ... I have studied as hard as I have so that I wouldn't have to clean houses or work at McDonalds," said one of my students whose parents brought her here from South America when she was just 9.
I was stunned when I found out that she was here illegally. "The government seems to think that by limiting us they will make us go back home. But that's not happening. My home is here. ... I will not give up my dreams for a better life," she said.
Don't dismiss them
Even undocumented kids who have ended up living the most difficult of lives here have no intention of going "back home." Take the senior at my school who told me that his uncle, who had been living here, paid "coyotes" $7,000 to bring him to Alexandria. This young man ended up working six days a week for a year-and-a-half in an Indian restaurant until he made enough to pay back his uncle. "I wanted to be someone in life, so I went to T.C. Williams after I paid the money back," he told me.
Granting blanket amnesty for all illegal immigrants would send the wrong message to those who became U.S. citizens by waiting their turn. Even so, it is long past the time to begin offering these students a better option. The DREAM Act, which would have provided these young people a path to citizenship if they attended college or joined the military for two years, again went down to defeat in the last Congress.
Perhaps a more palatable option could find its way through Congress. What about something similar to the H1B visa program, which is aimed at keeping the best and brightest foreign-born workers in the U.S.? At the very least, high school students who are illegal immigrants can be given a path to citizenship if they graduate from a four-year college or a two-year trade school in a field facing shortages, such as nursing.
Given the billions that has already been spent educating illegal children in our elementary and high schools, it seems only logical to let the most promising among them step out of the shadows to become productive citizens in our society.
Allowing them to be "someone in life" can only make all of our lives better.

Foreigners are taking their tech talents back home; Silicon Valley's loss is brain gain for India, China

At a time when the U.S. could use all the tech jobs it can get, Kunal Bahl is creating hundreds of them  in India.
The rub is he wanted to stay in the U.S. and build a company here, but visa issues forced him to leave and start SnapDeal in his native country. Four hundred employees later, he's ready to take on Groupon.
"Some things happen for the better," says Bahl, 28, whose H-1B visa permitting him to work in the U.S. expired in 2007. "I see huge opportunity in India because there are no mature companies, like Google and Microsoft, over there. The feeling  is like  in the U.S. in 1999."
The numbers speak for themselves:  SnapDeal, with $20 million in annual revenue, is on pace to top $100 million next year, he boasts. It is hiring 70 people a month.
"Rather than dreaming about being acquired by Groupon, (Bahl) dreams of acquiring it. This kid is building the Amazon.com of India," says Vivek Wadhwa, a visiting scholar at University of California-Berkeley  who released a report on immigration in late April, reflecting the trend.
What's happening is the nation is experiencing a brain drain.
"For the first time, immigrants have better opportunities outside the U.S.," Wadhwa says. Indeed, nearly half of 264 immigrants surveyed by Wadhwa said they wanted to start companies back home.
Silicon Valley may be the cradle for tech start-ups, but some foreign-born executives, engineers and scientists are leaving because of better opportunities back home, strict immigration laws here and California's steep cost of living.
President Obama highlighted the quandary in a speech Tuesday in El Paso. He pointed out that immigration reform is essential and that Intel, Google, Yahoo and eBay were all founded by immigrants.
There are no hard data available, but authorities agree the number of foreign-born workers returning to India and China annually is in the tens of thousands. The Chinese Ministry of Education estimates the number of Chinese who returned to China last year was a record 134,800, up 25% from 108,000 in 2009.
The Valley's loss is apparently India's gain. Once a haven for top-flight software engineers yet lagging in Internet use and e-commerce, India is now flush with Internet service companies vying to become the country's version of Amazon.com, Groupon or Expedia.
In China, where billions have been invested in research and development with limited success, American-educated and trained Chinese are returning home and playing a key role in helping major R&D labs innovate, Wadhwa says.
At the same time, the IPO market for tech companies in China is simmering. RenRen, the country's largest social-networking site by page views, surged in trading during its stock market debut this month. NetQin Mobile, an Internet security software developer, filed for a public offering this month.
The combination of  limited visas for foreign-born engineers and a dearth of college-educated engineers in the U.S. could help create a new wave of billion-dollar tech companies in India. Entrepreneurs such as Bahl are relocating to India and elsewhere to fulfill their start-up dreams  and compete with the very companies they once worked for in the U.S.
The reverse brain drain is thick with irony: While talented engineers return home to India, China and elsewhere by choice or by law, U.S. tech companies are furiously looking to hire engineering and tech-related talent.
The mini-exodus has also fomented a thriving industry of Valley-based investments in India-based tech start-ups. Vinod Dham, often called the "father of the Pentium chip," is founder of NEA-Indo US Venture Partners, which has put money into SnapDeal and other Indian start-ups.
Naren Gupta, co-founder of Nexus Venture Partners, has invested heavily in India-based tech firms, including PubMatic. The 5-year-old start-up, which helps publishers maximize their online ad revenue, was established in India and the U.S. but maintains its 100-person development team in India. "It is easier to find and retain engineers in India," says CEO Rajeev Goel, who has dual Indian and U.S. citizenship. "And it is more affordable."
"This market definitely has a lot of potential for technology professionals," says Amit Somani, 39, who earned a master's  at the University of Wisconsin and worked at IBM for 12 years before returning to India in 2007. He's now chief product officer at MakeMyTrip.com, India's largest e-commerce company.
Eric Diep hasn't given up entirely on the U.S. But most employees at his Redmond, Wash.-based social-gaming start-up, A Thinking Ape, are in another office in his native Canada. The 3-year-old company is shifting people to Vancouver, where it says engineering talent is more affordable, the government is more supportive and work visas are less hassle.
"It is super hard to hire talent in the U.S.," says Sabrina Parsons, CEO of Palo Alto Software, which provides software and Internet services to small businesses. The 50-person firm is struggling to fill four openings for Java developers.
A national issue
With tech workers in such high demand yet visas in short supply,  Obama is committed to an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws and wants to push Congress to pass a bill. Often, a lack of work visas blocks foreign talent from staying.  In the early 2000s, the national cap on work visas was 195,000. Today, it is about 65,000.
"If we bring high-skilled immigrants to come here, why wouldn't we want them to stay?" Obama said during a town hall meeting at Facebook in April. "They are job generators. We don't want them starting an Intel in China or France. We want them starting it here."
The talent-exodus problems don't end there. Fewer foreign students are coming to the Valley to earn engineering and science degrees, according to the Silicon Valley Index, which takes the economic pulse of the Valley each year. Obama said he is confident about passage of a federal education law by 2012  to help schools "do a better job of math and science education for women, Hispanics and blacks," the president said, to loud applause at Facebook. "We have to lift our game up for the Internet, math and science."
Previous research by Wadhwa revealed 52% of Silicon Valley start-ups were launched by immigrants, many of them highly educated products of Stanford,  UC-Berkeley and other schools.
"It makes no sense (that) we put up barriers to talented people," says Brad Feld, a tech venture capitalist and co-founder of Startup Visa Project, a grass-roots initiative.
Feld's organization has helped shape the Startup Visa Act of 2010, reintroduced this year by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Richard Lugar, R-Ind. It would grant immigrant entrepreneurs a two-year visa if they have the support of a qualified U.S. investor for their start-up venture.
"We want to establish a way for the smartest and most entrepreneurial individuals in the world to come to the United States and create jobs," Lugar says. "Many are already here studying at our great universities. Helping them stay to invest in their ideas and create jobs benefits all Americans."
But things are good enough economically in India and China that there is little incentive for many foreign-born to come to the U.S.  let alone stay.
Rather than worry about his job status, Bahl returned home and in short order built one of India's fastest-growing companies. SnapDeal  which sells travel packages, consumer goods such as shoes and electronics, and services for restaurants  has blossomed into the No.1-rated e-commerce site in India, according to Dataquest magazine and Sapient. SnapDeal is also listed among the top 1,000 sites in the world, says DoubleClick, an online advertising company owned by Google.
"E-commerce is growing four times faster than retail in India," says Bahl, who studied at the University of Pennsylvania and spent 2006-07 at Microsoft. "There is a general propensity to buy things online in India for convenience and access to aspirations."
Most of SnapDeal's hires are from India, where the company doesn't have to compete with Google and Microsoft for workers.
"After Groupon implodes, we will buy them," he says, laughing.
Irony abounds
Many employers note the irony of competing with the very people they wanted to retain or hire.
"That great engineer you want? He or she has easier access to capital and (is) starting companies with their friends, who are also top talent," says Michael Morell, managing partner at executive-recruiting agency Riviera Partners. Morell has helped place 200 developers at tech start-ups over the past year.
"A great engineer is 10 times more valuable than a good engineer," Morell says. "There is a war for top 10% talent."
Start-ups have adopted a number of strategies to cope with the dearth of top-flight workers.
Business data-sharing service Box.net is spending a chunk of the $50 million in funding it landed in February to  hire 40 people in the first quarter.  It plans to double its workforce, to up to 240, this year. "Google has more money than God, so we need cash to compete," says Aaron Levie, CEO of Box.net.
The cap on H-1B visas has prompted Meebo to use Skype and interactive whiteboards to collaborate with its six workers overseas, says Sandy Jen, Meebo's co-founder and vice president of engineering.
Many tech companies simply are going offshore to hire talent. The Praetorian Group, an online media company for first responders such as police officers, firefighters and paramedics, has outsourced about 14% of its 70 jobs to Web developers in Russia.
Ooyala, an online video-content service that works with Disney, Yahoo Japan and others, has a hybrid solution: 100 hires over the past year, most of them in the U.S., with pickups of engineers, support staff and salespeople in Mexico, Australia, Japan and the U.K. The 130-person company plans to add 50 more engineers this year.
In the end, talented tech workers who remain in the U.S. can expect to reap the benefits. The confluence of more start-ups, a tech-hiring binge and limited visas has set off a furious bidding war for talent  whether for folks looking for work or those comfortably employed.
"The winners are clearly those being wooed  here and abroad," says Rob McGovern, CEO of Jobfox, an online job service that has placed employees in the U.S. and helped outsource work to Pakistan and the Philippines. "The surprising number of people returning to India also reflects rising salaries there."

Re-election process is the root of the problem
In his opinion piece "Lobbyists aren't the problem," Bradley  Smith, chairman of the Center for Competitive Politics, made quite a stretch in saying that the problem is too much government power. It supposes that if somehow the size of government shrinks, then the lobbyists won't offer expensive trips or gifts to  members of Congress in return for their votes (Opposing view, Capital corruption debate, Nov. 21).
The problem is that once elected to Congress, people will do just about anything to get re-elected. And that means taking gifts from lobbyists in return for their votes. Then they get campaign contributions from the companies the lobbyists represent.
If there were term limits, this wouldn't happen. Lawmakers wouldn't have to raise funds to get re-elected. They could spend all their time doing the job they were elected to do.  Entrenched members of Congress are the problem, not the size of government.

Offer competitive wages
USA TODAY's article "Foreign firms troll for tech grads" started strong and then fizzled. It made the important point that there is no shortage of U.S. students to take tech jobs, if only U.S. companies offered them competitive salaries and hired them  (Money, Nov. 17).
Instead, foreign firms "are swooping in and recruiting" them, while U.S. politicians "decry a lack of engineering talent" and want to open the door to more low-paid, foreign non-immigrant temporary workers by increasing the number of H-1B visas.
Vivek Wadhwa is a leading proponent of this wage-cutting and outsourcing of U.S. jobs;  it is bizarre that you ended the story with his call to import more foreign tech workers to the U.S.

Lack of privacy expected
The recent privacy leaks by Facebook are irritating, but not very surprising. To be honest, a company  that broadcasts every  little action performed by its users to  each one of  his or her "friends" would naturally make use of  these tracking cookies  ("Member or not, visit Facebook, and it tracks you," Cover story, News, Nov. 16).
I doubt Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg or the company had any bad intentions; however, that does not justify  tracking customers' Web visits simply to  improve their product.
The company also has come under fire lately because of the hacking of profiles and the plastering of pornographic and graphic images on users' pages. This is the last straw to many people, with  some leaving the site possibly for other less intrusive social networking options.  This security weakness definitely  won't end Facebook's popularity,  but it also won't soon be forgotten in the minds of many  users.

Companies trying to hire highly skilled immigrant workers are in a bind. Their race to secure one of the 85,000 H-1B visas began Monday, but demand could exhaust the government's supply for this budget year in days. If petitions outpace supply in the first week, the Homeland Security Department -- for the first time since 2008 -- will hold a lottery to pick which companies will get visas to give to prospective employees.  It took 10 weeks to hit the visa cap in the last budget year, and more than 33 weeks the year before.

Ruben Navarrette Jr., CNN: "Every gang needs a leader.   The de facto leader of the 'Gang of Eight' is Marco Rubio. The Florida lawmaker  appeared on seven Sunday talk shows, discussing  the specifics of a comprehensive immigration reform bill that he hammered out with three other Senate Republicans and four Senate Democrats. The legislation is expected to be formally unveiled  (today). This means that, by Wednesday, just about everyone will be angry. Conservatives will declare the provisions of the bill too lenient, while Hispanics will condemn them as too punitive."
Chicago Tribune, editorial: "Before those immigrants could apply for green cards  the government would have to certify that the entire Mexican border was under U.S. surveillance, and that 90% of those who tried to cross illegally in certain high-risk zones were being stopped. In the meantime, the immigrants would be granted temporary legal status, allowing them to work and travel in the U.S. If and when the benchmarks are met -- it's expected that would take a decade or more -- the immigrants could be eligible for green cards. Three years later, they could apply for citizenship. That's 13 years at least. But it would allow them to live in the open, instead of living in fear of deportation."
Conn Carroll, The (Washington) Examiner: "The reality is that once the 'Gang of Ocho' grants illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, none of them will ever be deported and all of them will eventually become eligible for the full range of federal and state welfare programs.  Illegal immigrants do not come to this country for welfare. They come to American for jobs. But once they are here, they do avail themselves of the welfare state. And because they are less educated, and are less likely to speak English than the native population, they will use more welfare than native Americans, too."
Tom Hudson, The Miami Herald: "(Later this week),  the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on comprehensive immigration reform. While debate likely will concentrate on the controversial effort to forge a path to citizenship  immigration is about economic prosperity more than politics.  It's often said immigrants fill jobs Americans just won't do. Look no further than America's food chain.  As for highly skilled workers, it took less than a week this year for the government to hit the quota of H-1B visas."
Michael Barone, Real Clear Politics: "(Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick) Leahy promised that his committee would consider whatever proposal the Gang of Eight produces 'with all deliberate speed.' To Republican committee members' request for extended hearings, he decried 'artificial delays, delays for delays' sake.' Now it is certainly true that opponents of legislation will try to stretch the process out until it is too late to act. But it is also true that rubber-stamping the first draft of a bill hundreds of pages long can produce a law rife with unintended and unhappy consequences."
Matthew Cooper, National Journal:  "It's worth remembering that in 1986, Congress passed comprehensive immigration reform and it didn't work very well. The Immigration and Reform Control Act of 1986, or the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, granted a kind of amnesty. But it didn't stem illegal immigration, of course. This new  Rubio-blessed legislation may have momentum. But like all big shifts in policy   passage is just the beginning."

Tech firms fight hiring rules in immigration bill

Technology firms, exercising new political clout on Capitol Hill, are lobbying against a measure in the leading Senate immigration bill that would make it harder for them to recruit workers from abroad without first taking steps to hire Americans for highly skilled jobs in programming, engineering and other fields.
The measure would require job openings to be posted on a new government website for 30 days and order companies to first extend job offers to "equally or better qualified" U.S. workers. It would give the Labor Department the power to review and challenge those hiring decisions.
Proponents say the measures are needed to curb abuses by companies who they say use the visa program to hire cheaper labor. Technology firms say the proposed rules would cripple their ability to hire the best employees and represent inappropriate government intrusion.
The fight over hiring practices is part of the massive lobbying campaign underway on the immigration measure and will offer a fresh test of the technology industry's growing influence in Washington. The companies involved in the computer and Internet sectors spent nearly $140 million in lobbying last year - more than twice the $69 million the industry poured into influencing Washington a decade earlier, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to begin work on the bill Thursday.
The hiring battle centers on H-1B visas, which go mostly to college-educated foreigners in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. Technology companies say they face a chronic shortage of qualified workers in these fields. The United States sets an annual limit of 85,000 visas for these companies. This year, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services opened up the application process April 1, and the cap was reached within a week.
Industry groups have made big gains in the Senate's immigration proposal. The bill, for instance, increases the H-1B cap to 205,000 annually. But tech officials warn the new recruiting requirements could drive companies to move their skilled jobs overseas, rather than comply.
Under the bill, "employers are going to have an arbitrary government standard imposed on every hiring decision," said Robert Hoffman, a lobbyist for the Information Technology Industry Council. The proposed rule, he said, ignores subjective factors that influence hiring. "A perfect example: How does one define whether or not someone has the personality to fit into a corporate culture?" he said.
"We are not trying to change any of the fundamental policy goals that they are trying to achieve" in the Senate, Hoffman said. "We are just trying to tweak it."
Bruce Morrison, who lobbies on behalf of a group that represents American engineers, said the organization will object to any effort to "dilute worker protections."
The biggest users of H-1B visas are little-known staffing firms that provide foreign workers on a temporary basis to U.S. companies -- including banks and big retailers. Cognizant, a New Jersey-based firm, is the top user of the temporary visas, federal  records show. Most of its workers come from India.
The measure would make business harder for staffing companies. Starting in 2016, the bill would bar granting any new temporary visas for foreign workers at companies with more than half their workers on the visas.
Cognizant spokesman John Procter said the bill "would really change the way America does business."
"The company is very focused on educating legislators and making sure this language doesn't make its way into any final outcome," he said.

Senators chisel out details on tech job visas; Industry bites back on provision giving Labor power to review hires

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is pursuing closed-door negotiations with other key senators to ease requirements that high-tech companies first offer jobs to Americans before hiring overseas workers.
The provision is one of several industry-friendly amendments Hatch has proposed to the leading immigration bill in the Senate. In its current form, the bill would require companies to first extend job offers to qualified U.S. workers in fields such as programming and engineering before hiring foreign workers on temporary H-1B visas.
The bill also would give the Labor Department the power to review and challenge companies' hiring decisions for up to two years afterward.
The technology industry opposes that measure as  intrusive and is seeking to change provisions in the bill that require companies to promise to not lay off an American worker within 90 days of hiring a foreign worker.
During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this week, Hatch said he was working with other senators to revise some requirements in the bill drafted by the "Gang of Eight" Republican and Democratic senators.
"There's a whole high-tech world that's getting up in arms if we don't do this right," Hatch said. "They alone could make this bill very difficult to pass."
The Judiciary Committee could start voting on Hatch's proposals as early as today.
Hatch is a member of the committee, which has jurisdiction over the bill. New York Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a Gang of Eight member who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, has agreed to work with Hatch.
The tech industry has increasingly flexed its political muscle to help shape the bill. An advocacy group led by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has begun advertising to support the immigration overhaul.
Proponents of the immigration measure view Hatch as influential in gaining Republican support. Hatch has not said whether he will vote for the overall bill but made it clear that resolving the technology industry's concerns is a top priority for him.
Hatch's record indicates he is open to changes in the immigration system. More than a decade ago, he sponsored an early version of the DREAM Act, a bill that would have made it possible for the children of undocumented immigrants to attain permanent residency.
"Sen. Hatch has a long history of leadership on high-tech issues," said Dan Turrentine of TechNet, a leading technology trade group. "His interest in immigration and effort to ensure the workability of well-intentioned high-skilled reforms proposed by the Gang of Eight makes him a natural to be at the center of negotiations."
The tech industry already has made big gains in the bill, which would dramatically increase the number of available H-1B visas. On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected an effort from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, to strike a pro-industry provision that would allow companies to count H-1B visa holders who have applied for green cards as part of their U.S. workforce.
The bill would impose higher fees and more regulation for companies that rely on foreign guest workers for 15% or more of their workforce.

U.S. tech firms get break on hiring; Immigration bill deal softens regulations

A compromise  on the Senate's leading immigration bill Tuesday requires companies to make a good-faith effort to hire Americans for high-skilled technology jobs, but eases some of the tougher hiring requirements that U.S. tech firms faced in earlier drafts.
The Senate Judiciary Committee approved  new language Tuesday as it raced to complete work on the nation's biggest immigration overhaul in decades. Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, led negotiations on the deal.
To address the concerns of groups representing American workers, an original draft of the  bill required companies to first extend job offers to Americans before hiring workers on H-1B visas that go primarily to college-educated foreigners in science, tech, engineering and math fields. The bill also would have given the Labor Department the power to audit and challenge companies' hiring decisions for up to two years.  Tech companies considered those provisions onerous.
Under the Hatch-Schumer deal, the strictest hiring requirements, including Labor Department review, would apply only to companies that rely on H-1B visas for more than 15% of their full-time, skilled workers with college and advanced degrees. Hardest hit by that requirement: big outsourcing firms that employ mostly foreign workers -- mainly from India -- as consultants. But many U.S.-based tech companies that already hire a large share of American workers likely would escape additional Labor Department scrutiny.
"We feel if your company is hiring Americans 85% of the time for skilled positions, we are going to treat you differently," said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., another Judiciary Committee member who helped write the underlying bill. He had advocated  tough worker protections, but supported the compromise.
Proponents said the deal was an improvement from current law, which does not establish any requirements to hire U.S. workers.
The deal also eases rules that would have required a U.S. company to show it had not laid off an American worker within three months of hiring a visa holder from overseas. Under the compromise, companies hiring foreign workers specifically in science, tech, engineering and math fields could meet the requirement by stating in writing that they do not have the "intent" to replace American workers.
In what proponents say would be additional protections for workers, the deal also  significantly raises the base pay for H-1B workers, and would make it easier for visa holders to change companies once their employers have applied for green cards on their behalf. Under the current system, H-1B holders are tied to their employers. Once in line for a green card, they can't change jobs without losing their position in line for permanent residency.
The agreement, opposed by the AFL-CIO, is a sign of the tech industry's growing clout in Washington. Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith called Tuesday's vote a "significant step forward" that will promote "innovation, job creation and economic growth in the U.S."

Senate immigration debate far from over; Here are 5 things to watch as the bill moves forward

The drive to get the core of a historic immigration bill through a Democrat-controlled Senate committee ended in success, but showed how some aspects of the bill provide ammunition for critics who seek to derail the measure if it is not altered.
The bill, written by a bipartisan group Gang of Eight, would allow the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship. It also provides $6.5 billion to enhance border security and increases the number of high-tech and low-skilled workers allowed in on a temporary basis.
Here's a look at some of the issues that could resurface during debate:
More border security?
GOP committee members often cited the 1986 bill that granted amnesty to up to 3 million unauthorized immigrants, but did not fulfill its promise of securing the border. They tried several ways to further enhance the security components of the bill.
The bill calls for an additional 3,500 Border Patrol agents to man the nation's southwest border with Mexico. But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, proposed an amendment to raise that number to 40,000. His amendment was voted down.
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., tried to amend the bill to require the federal government to collect the fingerprints of every foreigner leaving the U.S. That would help government agencies keep track of people who leave and those who have stayed behind in violation of their visas.
A compromise was approved to test a fingerprint program at the nation's busiest international airports.
Limiting path to citizenship
Under the bill, most of the nation's unauthorized immigrants can apply for temporary legal status that allows them to live and work in the country for six months, then apply to get a green card in 10 years and U.S. citizenship three years later.
Sessions tried to bar people who could become "public charges" or receive government benefits from receiving any of legal status. Cruz filed an amendment that would allow unauthorized immigrants to gain the temporary legal status and also get green cards, but who would be barred from becoming full U.S. citizens. Supporters of the bill said that would create a permanent underclass of citizens and voted it down.
High-tech workers
The bill got a major boost when Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, reached a compromise with Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., on a visa program for highly skilled workers.
The original bill would have required companies using the H-1B visas to first extend a job offer to a qualified American worker before hiring a visa holder. It also gave the Department of Labor the power to audit companies for up to two years. Technology firms lobbied to strike those provisions, and the Hatch-Schumer compromise did so for a huge swath of U.S. tech companies.
The agreement will go a long way toward appeasing Republicans concerned about the burdens placed on the U.S. businesses, but it upset labor union advocates.
Diversity visa lottery
Some Democratic lawmakers were upset that the immigration bill eliminates the Diversity Visa Lottery, which grants up to 55,000 visas a year from underrepresented countries in an attempt to make the immigration system more merit-based. Even so, some senators have been able to carve out protections for some countries.
Same-sex couples
One of the most emotional moments over the five days of hearings was when committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., introduced an amendment to extend immigration rights to same-sex couples.
Under the amendment, U.S. citizens could petition for their spouses if they were legally married in another country. Leahy introduced the amendment, but withdrew it after several Democratic senators expressed their strong support but said it would ruin the chances of passing the overall bill.

There's no shortage of U.S. workers

Policy proposals from multinational corporations often come with slick, poll-tested rhetoric. It is always worth digging deeper.
And the more you dig into the idea that we need to hugely expand the number of employer-based temporary worker visas for tech companies, the more you uncover the truth: This is about powerful companies pursuing lower wages.
First, let's be clear. Immigration helps America. People who come here to pursue their dreams and aspire to be citizens strengthen our country. America's unions embrace immigrants and new citizens.
But we need the right rules and policies in place to reach our potential. When foreign temporary workers get stuck in a revolving-door system that does not give them a realistic chance to stay and become citizens, then the ladder to the middle class is broken. And this is definitely reason for concern.
We worry about corporations firing or passing over qualified American workers in order to import temporary foreign workers at lower wages.
We worry about a declining middle class as corporate profits reach record highs.
Americans aren't looking for handouts. We aren't looking to be hired for jobs for which we lack essential qualifications. We just want a fair chance to use the skills we have earned -- often at the cost of huge student loans -- to work our way into the middle-class jobs of the future.
High-tech companies say there are "too few" American high-tech workers, but that's not true.
Today there are 20,000 fewer African-American computer programmers and system analysts employed than in 2008.
In the fields of computer and information science and engineering, U.S. colleges graduate 50% more students than there are new hires.
Basic supply and demand suggests that if there were too few qualified tech workers, their average salaries would be going up. But tech wages haven't risen since Bill Clinton was president.
Clearly, high tech is not looking to bring in H-1B visa holders for a few years at a time because there is a shortage of tech workers. They want a massive expansion of H-1B visa holders because they can pay them less.
This is not about innovation and job creation. It is about dollars and cents.
Richard Trumka is president of the 12 million-member AFL-CIO.

To fill specialized jobs, technology companies sponsor H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers.
Much as I hate to agree with labor unions about anything, the spokesman for the AFL-CIO has it right on this one ("There's no shortage of U.S. workers," Opposing view, immigration debate, May 29).
It's the bean counters who have to hold costs down to provide a nice looking balance sheet for their company's annual report fanning the desire for these foreign workers.
Paul Hafner
We should have open immigration for highly skilled workers. They are not low-skilled workers who would get government assistance.
These highly skilled people would grow  the economy.
Mathew Andresen
People who want work but have no training have it rough.
I support Americans who need work. I've been unemployed, have started at bottom and know how it feels.
Jennifer Cobb
The nation faces a complex problem. Foreigners with in-demand skills compete for entry on a quota-limited H-1B visa.  If they're fortunate, they eventually might be able to change their status by applying for a "green card."  Each step, though, is fraught with uncertainty.
We do our darnedest to make it difficult for the very people we want to see arriving on our shores.
Mary Wheeler
Immigrants have made huge contributions to the success and betterment of the USA. However,  many companies are motivated to reduce overhead costs with highly qualified, inexpensive labor.
As a middle-aged, U.S. engineer displaced during the Great Recession, I can attest to the fact that foreign-born science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workers do replace capable U.S. workers.
The real truth is that much of the so-called STEM shortage is due to the policies put in place and practiced by American business.  College graduates with current training are favored over experienced employees with higher salary and benefit expectations. Formerly long-term positions are now really temporary jobs subject to short-term cycles and needs of the business.
The bottom line here is that there are plenty of qualified American workers.

There is something for almost everybody in the Senate's immigration bill, which was recently approved by the Judiciary Committee and is headed for the floor this week. At more than 1,000 pages, it lives up to its boast of being "comprehensive."
There is something for the high-tech industry in expanded H-1B visas that ease the way into this country for foreign techies.
There is a generous allowance of temporary workers for agribusiness. Big labor and big business sat down months ago and decided how many construction workers would be allowed in -- not so many as to deluge unionized labor and not so few as to disappoint the American business community's thirst for cheap labor.
Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., even got a generous visa allowance for foreign ski instructors.
What about public interest?
The interest that was not served in this giant auction, however, was the public interest and the values that we purport to uphold.
There is a lofty term in common use among conservatives who oppose the kind of reform that is making its way through the Senate. The phrase is "rule of law." Translated into every day speech it means "playing by the rules," a principle deeply embedded in our culture. You don't jump the line. You don't shortchange. And if you do, you shouldn't expect to be rewarded for it. The reward, in the case of the comprehensive immigration bill, comes in the form of "a pathway to citizenship."
Citizenship is the most precious gift that America can confer. For many people outside our borders, it is equivalent to winning a megabucks lottery. So why are members of the Senate so determined to grant it to people who did not play by the rules?
Democrats want to reward a constituency that has proved itself both loyal and influential. Republicans see it as a form of damage control, hoping to ingratiate themselves with Hispanic voters whom they have systematically alienated. Each party sees a political dividend in creating millions of new voters who could be registered upon receiving citizenship.
But conservatives might have a good point. Why confer an unmerited reward of citizenship on those who entered the country illegally?
Proponents of a path to citizenship argue on their behalf that they are living "in the shadows." But bringing them out into the sun light can be accomplished by legalization and registration. Our security will be enhanced because we will then know who and where they are. They will be spared from deportation and able to lead normal lives. For most, legal resident alien status will be enough. It is unlikely that removing the path to citizenship will cause many to pull up stakes and return to their native country.
DREAMers are exception
Now, there are about 2 million people judged as illegal who are completely blameless and should be placed on an expedited path to citizenship: the people brought to this country as children by illegally entering parents. For them, called the DREAMers after the DREAM Act, the shadows need to be lifted. They are certainly worthy of citizenship, much like non-citizens who served in the U.S. military after 9/11.
While lawmakers are at it, they might want to reassert the validity of the birthright provision of the 14th Amendment, which states that those born in the USA are citizens. Enough of the disparaging term "anchor babies," used by those who quibble with the amendment's plain language. They are our babies because they were born on our soil.
A long road ahead
The immigration process still has a long way to go. It will be subject to amendment on the floor of the Senate and then be taken up by the House, where many Republicans consider the citizenship provision objectionable.
Rather the risk losing the bill in its entirety, senators should be prepared to abandon the path to citizenship portion when they sit down with their House colleagues.
To endow a pathway that began in a violation of the law with the gift of citizenship is to venture down a road of moral hazard and perverse incentives that invites the gaming of the system.

Tech firms go abroad to hire; Why? Visa and skills shortage

While the path to U.S. citizenship sketched out in an immigration-reform bill passed by the Senate is a long one, a key part of one industry isn't waiting to see whether Congress delivers what it wants.
Even while technology-industry lobbyists fight hard in Washington to nearly double the number of annual visas for skilled foreign workers -- to 110,000, as the Senate bill calls for -- the CEOs of some fast-growing start-ups are already going overseas to find workers with the technical skills they need.
That includes Lew Cirne, CEO of New Relic, a San Francisco-based maker of software that boosts the efficiency of applications that run on corporate computer networks.
Of the 225 engineers working at its headquarters and Portland, Ore., office, just eight are foreign nationals in the U.S. on H-1B visas, Cirne says.
Yet two years ago, when he began to plan another product line -- "one that can help take us from a $100 million company (in annual revenue) to a billion-dollar company in a few years," he says -- he turned to a programmer who lives and works in Brisbane, Australia, to help develop New Relic's next-generation software code.
"We have a bias to hiring here. We're not looking to reduce costs by moving jobs overseas," says Cirne, whose previous start-up, Wily Technology, had more than 400 employees when it was acquired by CA Technologies, a larger rival, for $375 million in 2006. "We're competing for the top talent, no matter where it is," says Cirne, a native of Canada and naturalized U.S. citizen.
A growing number of small, private U.S. technology companies -- who, like, New Relic are late-stage start-ups with more than $100 million in annual sales -- now have engineering offices overseas.
A decade ago, such offices were de rigueur for start-ups backed by marquee venture-capital firms, who pushed their portfolio companies to move some engineering work overseas -- mostly to India -- to cut costs.
But that labor arbitrage never provided all the savings that companies had hoped for, once the rupee had risen to where the cost of office space in Mumbai equaled or even exceeded that of similar space in Silicon Valley, as it does today.
And the logistical headaches caused by trying to manage workers located many time zones away caused even some large companies to question the value of offshoring engineering work.
While the motivation for large U.S. technology companies to hire foreign workers back then was based primarily on a desire for cost savings -- and Microsoft, IBM, Cisco Systems and others all hired thousands of Indian engineers and consultants over the past decade for that reason -- the start-ups of today are hiring foreign workers in different places, and for different reasons.
Perhaps the most important reason -- along with trying to hire the best engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists -- is that doing so is so much easier than it used to be.
When San Francisco-based Zendesk was looking to open a development office in Europe in 2011, CEO Mikkel Svane and his two co-founders were able to begin their search using contacts they'd made in the software developer community of their hometown of Copenhagen.
The three Danes moved to San Francisco in 2009, when the help-desk software start-up they'd founded two years earlier outgrew the apartment where they'd launched it. Yet they'd been able to follow online the work of others who -- like them -- wrote code in a new programming language called Ruby on Rails.
While two-thirds of its 120 engineers and technical workers are located in San Francisco or Madison, Wis. -- home to the Badger State's largest university -- three dozen or so work either in London, Dublin, Tokyo, Berlin, Copenhagen or Melbourne, Svane says.
The company now employs almost 400 workers -- up from 90 just 24 months ago -- and has tripled its number of customers to 30,000 during that time, according to Svane.
A start-up's need to produce innovation on a tight budget against  better-funded rivals forces them to search high and low for workers who can deliver great new products -- and who will accept a lower wage than they'd get at a large company.
In exchange, those employees get the chance to work 70- to 80-hour weeks in hopes of building something that could be big.
People willing to take those kinds of risks are similar to the immigrants who -- like Cirne and Svane -- have come to this country for more than 200 years to pursue their own version of the American dream. About 40% of the current Fortune 500 companies are founded by immigrants or their children.
Other research has shown that, on average, every 100 foreign students who remain in this country after receiving an advanced degree in science, technology, engineering or math (a so-called STEM degree) create 262 additional jobs.
Before the days of online forums for computer-programming languages, small U.S. companies that wanted to compete for the best technical talent had to rely either on their own personal networks -- as Cirne did -- or try to compete with larger rivals for the graduates of advanced-degree programs at U.S. universities.
The percentage of foreign nationals enrolled in advanced STEM degree programs has remained fairly constant over the last two decades, 33% in 2009 from 31% in 1990, according to a report compiled for Congress in May 2012 by the Congressional Research Service.
During that same time, however, the total number of such students surged 64% to 149,000 from 91,000, as university programs sought to keep pace with a fast-growing industry.
The problem for U.S. tech companies is that, as the need to hire more skilled workers has increased, the number of visas for skilled workers hasn't.
Although Congress temporarily raised the number of annual H-1B visas to 115,000 in 1998, the limit reverted to 65,000 in 2004.
That means a growing number of workers with advanced STEM degrees from U.S. universities have been forced to go back to their home countries to look for work -- even while U.S. companies want to hire them.
"I get calls every day from hiring managers and (human resource) execs looking to bring in foreign STEM workers into the U.S. to help them grow their businesses here," says Charles Small, an immigration attorney in San Francisco for more than a decade.
But given a six-month minimum wait time, and the fact that the 65,000 cap on H-1Bs for this year was reached on the very first day that the government began accepting visa applications, any skilled foreign worker that a company found today couldn't start work until Oct. 1, 2014, at the earliest, Small says.
With the Senate moving on a tech-friendly bill, those working on raising the number of H-1B visas now turn their attention to the House, which in past years has voted out of committee several bills that would establish a new type of visa for workers in STEM fields.
There is a new sense of urgency after several other countries -- including Canada, Australia and Chile -- have loosened their own immigration laws to make it easier for their own companies to hire skilled foreign workers. "The tech industry will do everything it can to get a bill passed ... that makes sure the U.S. remains the center of innovation," says Dean Garfield, CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council, an industry trade group.
As things slowly move forward in Washington, start-ups are going wherever they can to find more skilled workers. King.com, a maker of some of the most popular social games on Facebook, has 100 engineers in Stockholm. Its website lists dozens of open tech jobs in London, Hamburg, Barcelona, Bucharest and several other overseas offices.
Zendesk now lists all new engineering positions in each of its multiple locations around the globe. That approach has helped the company overcome "the huge challenge of trying to hire technical talent in San Francisco, where the competition is so fierce," says CEO Svane.
So rather than debate whether more skilled foreign workers will take jobs away from Americans, perhaps Congress should pass a bill that prevents more high-skilled jobs from heading overseas.

Immigration debate ensnares foreign workers; Bill would crack down on swindling of foreigners trying to reach U.S.

Sukh Singh had a college degree in mechanical engineering and a dream of working in the United States, but that seemed impossible from his small farming village in northern India.
Then a man named Sukhwinder came to town in November. He says he had just come back from America. He dressed the part, with designer jeans, distinct T-shirts and "fancy sunglasses." He even talked the part, sporting close to an American accent. He says he could help college grads find a job in a big American city for a big engineering firm. Ears perked up when he mentioned Austin as a possible destination.
An excited Singh persuaded his father to sell some of his farmland to pay Sukhwinder for a visa. Singh's father agreed, they collected the cash and handed over more than $40,000.
The next morning, Sukhwinder disappeared.
"It's almost impossible for a person to migrate to the U.S. on their own because the system is so complicated, so everyone goes through an agent," Singh says. "So giving money to Sukhwinder did not seem strange or out of place."
Cracking down on recruiters who swindle foreigners trying to legally reach the U.S. on work visas is one of the rarely discussed, but potentially transformational, portions of a bill passed by the Senate last month.
As Congress considers the bill, Democrats and Republicans continue to disagree about the core questions of how best to secure the nation's borders and what to do with the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country.
But if those disagreements end up killing the bill, they will also sink dozens of changes to immigration law that are generally agreed to by both parties. Those include increasing the number of visas for high-tech, easing the process for agricultural companies to bring in foreign workers and a crackdown on corrupt foreign labor recruiters like Sukhwinder.
"I think ultimately it will be adopted in some form in some way," says Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., whose office wrote the recruiter provisions in the Senate bill. "I'm not frustrated ... yet."
Under the bill passed by the Senate, foreign labor recruiters for the first time would have to register with the U.S. government. They would have to post a bond and open themselves up to the jurisdiction of the American court system for visa-holders who feel they've been mistreated.
Naomi Tsu, a senior staff attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has represented several immigrant workers in lawsuits against employers, says the restrictions are critical because foreign labor contractors serve as the "doorkeepers of the American dream" yet live in an unregulated, mostly unpunished world.
"Current law has not caught up to the realities of international hiring," Tsu says.
And while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says the restrictions are too broad and need to be changed, they support the overall goal.
"We're well aware of the problem and are obviously against human trafficking," says James Plunkett, director of labor law policy for the chamber. "But some of the problems we saw with this title are that it went beyond what most people would consider to be 'examples of human trafficking.'"
DREAM DESTINATION
Many Americans may take it for granted, but the U.S. remains a place where countless people want to immigrate to every year.
Manpreet Badal, who heads India's People's Party of Punjab, a political party, says young people in his northern Indian region have always tried to find their way to America: "Even our popular culture -- our songs and films -- reflect this desire. The idea is to make a fortune in a foreign land -- in a way, it coincides with the idea of the American dream."
South of the border, where U.S. companies recruit many agricultural workers on H-2A visas and other lower-skilled workers through H-2B visas, most people aren't even looking for a fortune -- they're just looking for a living wage for themselves and their families.
Gabriel López, a construction worker from the Mexico City suburb of Nezahualcóyotl, has made two dangerous crossings into the U.S. -- once across the Rio Grande, and once through the barren desert of New Mexico, where he resorted to eating cactus leaves to survive.
He did all that simply to work in a North Carolina factory and on construction sites in New York City so he could send $200 a week back to his wife and three children in Mexico.
RIPE FOR EXPLOITATION
That desperation creates a worldwide pool of people who are ripe for exploitation.
In India, where many U.S. companies find engineers through H-1B visas, there's even a phrase for it: kabootarbaazi. The literal translation is "pigeon hunting," with the pigeon viewed as a weak and gullible person.
Recruiters must pay a hefty fee and register with the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs to operate there, but complaints of mistreatment are everywhere. It's so perilous that Sandeep Garg, CEO of Overseas Career, a recruiting agency in New Delhi, says he often discourages people who come to him for help.
"They don't realize how tough the process of getting to the States is," Garg says. "But people are quite insistent."
In parts of China, another big source of H-1B visa recipients, more than half of Chinese workers may use "informal channels" to go abroad, says Huang Leping, director of the Beijing Yilian Legal Aid and Research Center of Labor, a non-profit dedicated to providing free legal aid for workers.
Two kinds of companies in China are able to recruit workers and send them abroad, he says: labor-export organizations, approved by local governments, and Chinese companies -- often state-owned behemoths -- that have branches or programs abroad. But the situation is complicated by recruitment agencies that promise a lot, and may deliver little, says Huang. "They tell workers, 'The salary is high, the benefits are excellent, and there will be skills training,' but the reality when they get there is far from what they said," he says. Some workers must endure terrible work conditions on very low salaries, and suffer occupational illnesses, but are unable to return home, says Huang.
In an April report, the International Labor Recruitment Working Group, a collection of labor organizations, found that workers in every visa category are forced to pay high, and illegal, recruitment fees to even be considered for a visa.
Mexicans who work in the Maryland crab industry paid on average $750 for their visas, according to the report. Guatemalans who work in American forestry programs paid about $2,000 for visas and travel. Thai farmers paid up to $21,000 to work in Washington state.
Patricia Pittman, a professor at George Washington University and executive director of the Alliance for Ethical International Recruitment Practices, says highly educated workers get duped, too, because of how desperate they are to get to America. But she says about 50% of nurses her group surveyed who came into the U.S. from 2003 to 2007 suffered some kind of abuse.
"People tend to assume that higher-skilled workers are not vulnerable to this kind of abuse," she says. "But these nurses, they had their passports withheld, or had their contract change without their consent, or arrived in the United States not knowing where they were going to work."
Making matters worse is that mistreated foreign workers in the U.S. can't get to those recruiters.
Tsu of the Southern Poverty Law Center has helped exploited workers sue recruiters who are in the U.S. But because it's difficult for the U.S. government to prosecute a foreigner for actions in a foreign country, they are generally out of reach.
"The recruiter often never sets foot in the United States," Tsu says.
The Senate bill changes all that.
For the first time, foreign labor contractors will be required to register with the U.S. Department of Labor, submit their fingerprints, open themselves to court action in the U.S. judicial system, and post a bond that can be used to pay workers who win any court cases, or pay fees levied by the U.S. government.
U.S. employers will be required to use registered labor contractors, or risk exposing themselves to lawsuits and government fees.
Once registered, the contractors are forbidden from charging fees to visa applicants, must offer them binding contracts outlining their jobs in America and will be required to abide by a variety of U.S. hiring laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
"The lever that's applied is essentially the jurisdiction and authority of the U.S. over its visa, and the right of labor recruiters to send people to this country," Blumenthal says. "When they commit a bait and switch in recruiting, when they lure innocent workers into modern-day slavery, they should be held accountable."
Officials with the chamber are fighting back on some provisions.
They wonder how the U.S. can extend very detailed, highly litigated hiring rules to recruiting situations abroad.
"We view this as way overly broad," says Randy Johnson, the chamber's senior vice president of labor.
Thorough overhaul?
Some big users of foreign work visas will not be subject to the new restrictions. Companies such as Microsoft, which finds most of its foreign engineers on American college campuses, will not have to register its recruiters with the government. The restrictions will mostly target international outsourcing firms, such as Infosys and Wipro, that secure the visas and provide their workers to U.S. companies.
Some feel that foreign governments need to help the U.S. crack down on the worldwide problem.
"A thorough overhaul of recruitment agencies is needed. Many of the smaller agencies are fly-by-night operations and completely unaccountable," says Geoffrey Crothall, communications director for China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based labor rights group that has researched Chinese labor-recruitment agencies that send workers overseas.
"It should be the Ministry of Commerce that has responsibility for it, but there are so many layers of subcontracting, and recruiters working at different levels, who all want a cut of the recruitment fee, so workers must pay such a high fee."
Garg, the Indian recruiter, says the U.S. government should coordinate directly with the Indian government to get a handle on the problem.
"No matter how much regulation this new bill brings in, the illegal recruiters will always find some loophole or other," Garg says. "That's their job -- they look for loopholes like hawks and always find them, and exploit them. For the United States to effectively regulate these illegal practices, they have to hook up with some department in India."
All those possibilities will have to wait until Congress figures out what to do with immigration reform. In the meantime, people such as Singh will continue waiting. "I still want to go to the U.S.," he says. "I am sure I will go someday. Next time I will just have to be more careful."

Lobbyists can't win on immigration; Despite the large number of pro-reform efforts, their potency is diluted by different agendas.

When I Googled the word "lobbyist" recently, just below the usual Wikipedia definition there appeared, in quick succession, the following three news entries: "Kevin Michael Krufky, a tech lobbyist, faces sex solicitation charge"; "Conservative Lobbyist Derails Bipartisan 'Science Laureate' Bill"; and "No public tours, but 344 visits by lobbyists to the White House."
These all play into a distorted public perception of interest groups and the lobbyists who represent them as sleazy and underhanded but, above all, effective. So how is it that some of America's most powerful interest groups, which have joined forces to apply their considerable influence to get Congress to pass immigration reform, have failed so conspicuously?
It is easy to look to Congress and, depending on your politics, see either a small group of willful right-wingers or a platoon of redoubtable patriots blocking the legislation. Certainly, the unwillingness of the House leadership to bring up any legislation that is not supported by a majority of Republicans is the most obvious source of blockage. And a lengthy government shutdown won't help matters. But equally worthy of attention is the vaunted coalition of big-name corporations, trade associations, wealthy individuals, unions and civic organizations whose  lobbyists have pushed for immigration reform and have managed only to wrestle it through one chamber of Congress.
A potent lineup
The list is impressive. According to OpenSecrets.Org, a component of the Center for Responsive Politics, the 573 groups that have lobbied the immigration reform bill (the  majority being in favor) included Microsoft and the Christian Coalition; Facebook and the AFL-CIO; The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Roofing Contractors Association; The Human Rights Campaign and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.
The list also suggests the magnitude of the lobbying effort because it includes the number of reports lobbyists are required to file with the secretary of the Senate and the clerk of the House. The varying levels of activity among the groups lobbying the bill are quite revealing.
Four of the top five filers are tech companies, which are interested in obtaining lots of H-1B visas for those talented software engineers and programmers from India. This is our first clue that different interest groups have different kinds of skin in the game. The Associated Builders and Contractors, which is No. 8 in the number of lobbying reports, no doubt are in favor of the very people that the tech lobbyists care nothing about. The breadth of the pro-immigration reform lobbying effort is impressive, but strength in numbers is immaterial if everyone has a different agenda.
Signing on to lobby for comprehensive immigration reform, for one, involves little cost. Polls seem to strongly support comprehensive immigration reform. So the list of  573 groups contains many nominal members. On the face of it, Hewlett-Packard with its hunger for more H-1B visas is putting in more effort to get the bill through Congress than the Discovery Science Center, which has filed only a couple of lobbying reports.
Effectiveness overstated
It is a myth, moreover, to believe that lobbyists are universally effective. Jeffrey Birnbaum, who has written extensively on lobbying, has noted that it is on the margins, "in relatively small changes to larger pieces of legislation," where they make their money. The classic example is in changes to a minor provision of a tax bill. This kind of legislative fine-tuning almost always escapes the attention of the news media, but it is in these highly public national debates that lobbyist influence diminishes.
Within the immigration reform movement are members who dominate their own policy area but might be ineffective venturing into others. So while the National Association of Realtors might be successful in defending the home mortgage interest deduction, it has much less credibility in the field of immigration.
To be sure, groups such as the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization, have a deep emotional stake in the success of the legislation, and the top filer, Microsoft,  stands to gain as a corporation. But it is less clear why Dance/USA or the American Symphony Orchestra League would invest much in immigration reform when efforts to reverse the decline in funding for the arts would seem to be time better spent.
A minority of House Republicans could be the rock on which immigration reform founders, but the power of the wave that propels it might be less than a tsunami.

Hiring foreign talent may get easier

The Obama administration wants to let nearly 100,000 spouses of foreigners working in high-tech fields to work here as well in a move critics say is harmful to nearly 10 million jobless Americans.
The administration also hopes to ease the process for foreign professors and researchers trying to extend their stays in America.
The proposed changes, announced Tuesday by Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, come as high-tech companies and university officials continue pressing Congress and the Obama administration to ease restrictions that they say make it difficult to import highly skilled foreign workers.
Groups such as FWD.us, created by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and other tech organizations are lobbying Congress for expanded visa programs to hire foreign workers.
"The proposed rules provide important support to U.S. businesses while also supporting economic growth here in the U.S.," Mayorkas said. "This enhances our country's competitiveness to attract skilled workers."
But critics accuse the pro-visa groups of wanting cheap labor and say Obama should be helping U.S. citizens get jobs rather than making it easier for foreigners to expand their employment opportunities in the United States.
"The U.S. already provides businesses with 700,000 temporary guest workers every year to compete against unemployed Americans, in addition to the annual flow of 1 million permanent legal immigrants," said Stephen Miller, a spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who has opposed efforts to import  foreign workers.
"The administration's unilateral decision to increase that number will hurt already struggling American workers."
The proposed changes will be published in the Federal Register this week and be open to 60 days of public comment before they can be implemented.
The first proposed change affects holders of H-1B visas. It would let the spouses of those who are applying for a green card to not only move to the U.S. but also find work. The second proposed change focuses on visa holders  from Chile, Singapore, Australia and the Northern Mariana Islands, lengthening the time they could stay in the U.S.

Reynolds American is in talks to buy Lorillard in a complex, three-way deal that could see British American Tobacco take a major role to back a potential merger, according to a CNBC report late last week. It would combine the second- and third-largest U.S. tobacco firms, putting brands such as Reynolds' Camel and Lorillard's Newport under one roof.
NUMBER OF THE DAY
85,000
The federal government issues up to 85,000 H-1B visas to businesses every year, and recipients can stay up to six years. Amid calls for expanding the program, there is growing push back from Americans who argue it has been hijacked by staffing companies that import cheaper, lower-level workers to replace more expensive U.S. employees—or keep Americans frombeing hired in the first place. Experts estimate there are at least 600,000 H-1B visas at any one time.
TROUBLED LULULEMON EXPLORES GOING PRIVATE
Struggling maker of yoga wear Lululemon Athletica has been sounding out private-equity firms about taking the publicly traded company private, according to "The Wall Street Journal." No deal is imminent, but it shows the company is  exploring options. Its stock price is down 45% in the past eight months on manufacturing problems and disappointing earnings.

Bill Gates' tech worker fantasy; Silicon Valley has created an imaginary staffing shortage

Business executives and politicians endlessly complain that there is a "shortage" of qualified Americans and that the U.S. must admit more high-skilled guest workers to fill jobs in STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and math. This claim is echoed by everyone from President Obama and Rupert Murdoch to Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates.
Yet within the past month, two odd things occurred: Census reported that only one in four STEM degree holders is in a STEM job, and Microsoft announced plans to downsize its workforce by 18,000 jobs. Even so,  the House is considering legislation that, like the Senate immigration bill before it, would increase to unprecedented levels the supply of high-skill guest workers and automatic green cards to foreign STEM students.
As longtime researchers of the STEM workforce and immigration who have separately done in-depth analyses on these issues, and having no self-interest in the outcomes of the legislative debate, we feel compelled to report that none of us has been able to find any credible evidence to support the IT industry's assertions of labor shortages.
Stagnant wages
If a shortage did exist, wages would be rising as companies tried to attract scarce workers. Instead, legislation that expanded visas for IT personnel during the 1990s has kept average wages flat over the past 16 years. Indeed, guest workers have become the predominant source of new hires in these fields.
Those supporting even greater expansion seem to have forgotten about the hundreds of thousands of American high-tech workers who are being shortchanged -- by wages stuck at 1998 levels, by diminished career prospects and by repeated rounds of layoffs.
The facts are that, excluding advocacy studies by those with industry funding, there is a remarkable concurrence among a wide range of researchers that there is an ample supply of American workers (native and immigrant, citizen and permanent resident) who are willing and qualified to fill the high-skill jobs in this country. The only real disagreement is whether supply is two or three times larger than the demand.
Unfortunately, companies are exploiting the large existing flow of guest workers to deny American workers access to STEM careers and the middle-class security that should come with them. Imagine, then, how many more Americans would be frozen out of the middle class if politicians and tech moguls succeeded in doubling or tripling the flow of guest workers into STEM occupations.
Redundant reforms
Another major, yet often overlooked, provision in the pending legislation would grant automatic green cards to any foreign student who earns a graduate degree in a STEM field, based on assertions that foreign graduates of U.S. universities are routinely being forced to leave. Such claims are incompatible with the evidence that such graduates have many paths to stay and work, and indeed the "stay rates" for visiting international students are very high and have shown no sign of decline. The most recent study finds that 92% of Chinese Ph.D. students stay in the U.S. to work after graduation.
The tech industry's promotion of expanded temporary visas (such as the H-1B) and green cards is driven by its desire for cheap, young and immobile labor. It is well documented that loopholes enable firms to legally pay H-1Bs below their market value and to continue the widespread age discrimination acknowledged by many in the tech industry.
When considering the credibility of the industry's repetitive claims of "shortages," it is worth recalling its history of misbehavior in hiring and employment. The most recent example was the proposed $300 million legal settlement of a class action against companies such as Google, Apple, Intel and Adobe for anti-competitive collusion to suppress the pay of highly skilled employees, including unlawful agreements to not recruit each others' workers.
IT industry leaders have spent lavishly on lobbying to promote their STEM shortage claims among legislators. The only problem is that the evidence contradicts their self-interested claims.

Tech diversity is next civil rights step, Jackson says

Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called on the Obama administration Monday to scrutinize the tech industry's lack of diversity.
"The government has a role to play" in ensuring that women and minorities are fairly represented, Jackson told a USA TODAY editorial board meeting. He said the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission needs to examine Silicon Valley's employment contracts.
Jackson met earlier with Labor Secretary Tom Perez to press for a review of H-1B visas, which allow U.S. companies to hire foreigners for specialty jobs. He said data show Americans have the skills and should have first access to high-paying tech work.
"There's no talent shortage. There's an opportunity shortage," he said, calling Silicon Valley "far worse" than many others such as car makers who have been pressured by unions. He said tech behemoths have largely escaped scrutiny by a public dazzled by their products.
Jackson has lobbied nearly two dozen tech companies to disclose hiring data, and about a dozen have done so.
Men make up 62% to 70% of the staffs of Twitter, Google, Facebook, Yahoo and LinkedIn, while whites and Asians comprise 88% to 91%, according to the data.  Their dominance is highest in computer programming and other tech jobs that tend to pay the most.
"This is the next step in the civil rights movement," Jackson said, noting minorities represent a sizable share of tech consumers but not its workers. Of Twitter's U.S. employees, 3% are Hispanic and 5% black, but those groups along with Asian Americans account for 41% of its U.S. users.

LETTERS
I was pleased to see the results of impartial research on the science, technology, engineering and math  workforce in the commentary "Bill Gates' tech worker fantasy" (Monday). It confirms what I and many tech workers have observed:  The tech industry is misleading people to believe there is a shortage of Americans qualified to fill STEM jobs.
The tech industry's motive is to get Congress to continue to expand the availability of H-1B temporary visas for foreign workers  to create a supply of cheap, young labor.
I suppose this shouldn't be a surprise. More disappointing is how willing Congress has been to cave in to tech industry lobbying.  It's time for members of Congress to back up their claim that they care about promoting a strong middle class with well-paying, skilled jobs.

Looking for an internship this summer, my son queried about five Intel hiring managers for positions. Despite being a junior in computer systems engineering  and having a high GPA, no one responded, not even with a "thank you for your interest."
If tech companies' tales of woe were real, they would be desperate to get such a candidate into the pipeline. Truth is, the engineering job market is flush with job-seekers, and tech companies are reaping the benefit.
Derek Davis
Some college graduates realize they don't like the field they studied and get a job in one different from their degree.
You can't expect all STEM-educated workers to stay in the field just because that was their area of study.
Jay Guild
Bill Gates does not represent STEM.  Microsoft, Facebook and other tech companies employ only a portion of the technology workers.
Keith Williams
Ask anyone who has been replaced in a tech job if his replacement was given a higher wage than he was making. This is economics 101. Flood the market with labor and watch as wages fall.
You don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand the law of supply and demand.

Work visas tougher to snag; Foreign employees of U.S. firms affected

Foreign employees of U.S. companies are having a harder time getting into the country under a specialized visa category, according to a report being released today.
About 35% of petitions by American companies to bring to the U.S. employees working overseas who have a "specialized knowledge" in their fields were denied in 2014 by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the fourth straight year that figure has risen. The denial rate for those visas, known as L-1B visas, was as low as 6% in 2006, according to the report from the National Foundation for American Policy, an immigration advocacy group.
The biggest increase in denials affected Indian nationals trying to get into the USA. Applications for Indians were denied 56% of the time, compared with 22% for Chinese, 21% for Mexicans and 19% for French, according to data obtained by the foundation through a Freedom of Information Act request.
Stuart Anderson, executive director of the foundation, said that the steady rise in denials started in 2008, when the United States was plunging into a deep recession.
He said that has led to a "protectionist" culture at the immigration enforcement agency in favor of American technology workers.
Anderson said denying visas to Indians and others with high-tech backgrounds is a "misguided attempt" to protect U.S. workers and will end up forcing companies to ship more jobs overseas. "If you're making it more difficult to transfer employees to work in America, then you're more likely to see that work take place outside the United States," Anderson said.
Others say the rise in denials is more the result of the government concluding that companies were taking advantage of the visa system to bring in cheaper competition for American technology workers.
Most high-tech foreign workers enter the country through the H-1B visa program, which grants up to 85,000 visas a year to foreigners trained in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to consider a bipartisan bill that would expand and possibly more than double the number of visas granted each year.
Some on the committee said the H-1B program, and others like it, should be reduced or restructured to better protect American workers.
"The program was intended to serve employers who could not find the skilled workers they needed in the United States," said committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.
"Over the years the program has become a government-assisted way for employers to bring in cheaper foreign labor, and now it appears these foreign workers take over -- rather than complement -- the U.S. workforce."
Shin Inouye, a spokesman for USCIS, said it would need to review the full report before commenting on the findings.
"USCIS decides each request for an immigration benefit or service on a case-by-case basis, based on the totality of the evidence provided and all relevant legal requirements," he said.

Music stops for TimeDance, but lives go on
USA TODAY
September 18, 2000, Monday,

PALO ALTO, Calif. -- The demise of TimeDance, an online event-planning
site, went relatively unnoticed this summer. Internet watchers
were more interested in the collapse of such highfliers as apparel
retailer Boo.com, Disney-backed Toysmart.com and entertainment
site Reel.com.
"It was just this downward spiral," says TimeDance co-founder
Walter Colesman. "We were a victim of the Internet frenzy."
Few felt the effects of that whirl more than TimeDance's 38 employees,
who worked out of a renovated 1950s department store in Redwood
City, Calif. They watched as an expert -- whom employees called
"The Wolf," after the cleanup character in Pulp Fiction
-- was hired in June to shut the company that they had helped
build.
Businesses go under every day, of course. Yet failure is becoming
alarmingly common in Silicon Valley. About 45 Internet companies
went out of business in the first eight months of this year, according
to Webmergers, which tracks Web site mergers and acquisitions.
That's hit thousands of people like an earthquake. More than 11,785
dot-com employees lost their jobs during that eight-month period,
according to Challenger Gray & Christmas, which tracks job-cut
announcements.
To get an insight into the problem, USA TODAY's Deborah Kong followed
four former employees as they coped with the death of TimeDance
and reassessed their lives and careers.
On June 28, Stuart West, the company's vice president of business
development, sent an e-mail to employees telling them TimeDance
was going out of business.
Here's what happened next:
Founder of failed start-up steps back, plans next move
Days after the company he co-founded closed its doors, a depressed
Walter Colesman headed as far as he could get from the wired hubbub
of Silicon Valley.
He traded his PalmPilot, Internet connection, and cellphone for
a creased map his grandfather used almost 50 years ago and set
out for the Canadian Rockies.
"I certainly had no intention of checking e-mail or using any
of that stuff," says Colesman. The affable 33-year-old was burned
out and mourning the death of his company. "I just didn't want
to deal anymore."
On a drizzly July day, Colesman and his wife, Christy, hiked seven
miles up a steep path to Skoki Lodge in Banff National Park. At
the lodge, which has no electricity, running water or television,
Colesman and his wife, an attorney at Hewlett-Packard spinoff
Agilent Technologies, bathed in a cold stream, used flashlights
to make their way to the outhouses and read by kerosene lamp about
the area's history.
For 11 days, Colesman canoed in serene emerald-green lakes and
hiked alongside mountain goats and wild sheep. Without another
person in sight, "it really gave me time to sort of sit back
and relax and just admire nature and realize that life's short,"
he says. "Not all start-ups always work out. Meanwhile, you only
have one life to live."
Looking back on his sleep-deprived 12-to-14-hour workdays, there
were too many weeks he canceled his vacations "because, well,
we changed the whole direction of the company, for instance,"
Colesman says, wryly. "At the time, it seemed super critical."
Back at the lodge, Colesman tried to explain TimeDance to other
guests from Spokane, Wash. Sending online invitations was a foreign
concept to them.
All too soon, however, it was back to civilization. In early August,
Colesman returned to his Palo Alto apartment and began pondering
his next move. It's almost like there are two worlds out there,
Colesman says: one prior to the mid-April stock market plunge,
and one afterward.
In the pre-crash world, job candidates asked questions about the
company -- when was it going public, did it have backing from
marquee venture capitalists, and how many users did it plan to
attract?
These days, it's, 'OK, what's your business model, let me see
your balance sheets,' " he says. "I like revenue, I like positive
cash flows." He's not worried about telling recruiters that he
founded a company that failed. In fact, the savvy Harvard Business
School grad thinks it's a selling point.
"They know that you understand what it's like to be in a start-up,"
he says. "I've had to clean out my desk drawer and put it in
a box and walk out the door. I don't ever want to do that again."
Casting a wide net, Colesman talks to everyone from a guy in a
garage to a 100-person company. Over the next few weeks, Colesman
interviews at Zoho, an online marketplace for hospitality buyers
and suppliers, two customer research start-ups and venture capital
investment bank Garage.com. The positions range from a co-founder
to vice president of marketing to an investment adviser.
In mid-August, all is quiet in Silicon Valley, and Colesman decides
to put off the job search until September. He begins some consulting
projects, figuring it's a good way to learn more about different
companies before deciding to join one full time. And he can pay
his bills and still say he's working.
Lately, Colesman has been carrying a bright green notebook the
size of a paperback that he picked up in an art supplies store.
He uses it to jot down ideas for new businesses.
He scribbles the ideas -- a couple of words, a few pages, and
diagrams -- as they come to him. The flashes come almost anytime,
jogging through the Palo Alto foothills, surfing the Web at night,
reading business publications, driving to meetings, or watching
his wife work.
"I'm starting to wonder if founding a company isn't easier than
finding a good job."
Software engineer spins his wheels waiting for transfer of
 his work visa
Jehad Baker had to act fast. He holds a temporary H-1B work visa.
If he couldn't find a new job within two weeks, he might be forced
to leave the country.
He was lucky. The software engineer from Jordan was hired by IdeaMetrix,
which helps companies measure their customers' Web experience.
But Baker couldn't start immediately. It took two months for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to transfer his work visa
to his new employer. During that time, he had no paycheck or health
insurance.
That hurt when his 7-month-old daughter, Deena, needed shots.
And one day, his son, Ahmad, was scratched by the family's German
shepherd.
"It was just raising the flag again: 'See? Stuff like this can
happen,' " Baker says. "What if something major happened?"
Baker has been through this before. The INS took four months to
transfer his visa to TimeDance after his former employer, Tyecin
Systems, closed its office in 1999.
"It's not fair. Why do you have to wait like this?" says Baker,
a jovial man who seems older than his 29 years. "It doesn't make
sense. I pay a lot of taxes. I do what's required of me to do.
I'm in demand. Why treat me like this?"
While he waited, he restlessly chatted online with other anxious
applicants and checked Web sites that report the backlog at the
INS. In early August, the agency was still processing applications
it received at the end of May.
The delays could get worse. There's a huge demand for the visas,
mostly from talent-hungry high-tech companies. That's limited
by law to 115,000 this year and 107,500 in the next, which starts
in October. But bills in the House and Senate would increase the
number issued to about 200,000 for the next three years.
On Aug. 21, Baker learned from his attorney that his transfer
was approved. Yet he was in no mood to celebrate.
"The problem is, you will always have this H-1 thing going on,"
Baker says. "You're not really secure like if you have a green
card or if you have citizenship. You never really establish a
life."
His visa expires in 2003, and he estimates it would take as long
as six years to get a green card that would make him a permanent
U.S. resident.
That's why he may follow some friends to Canada. He has applied
for the Canadian equivalent of a green card, a process that should
take about six months.
"At least I will know that nobody can kick me out and that my
kids will just stay and get raised and go to school," Baker says.
"It's worth it."
Marketing manager devotes unplanned time off to planning wedding
For Michelle Leone, saying goodbye to TimeDance was like bidding
farewell to two companies. In February, Leone and three friends
sold their start-up, Invitemetoo, to TimeDance.
Leone, who became a marketing manager at TimeDance, decided not
to plunge into a job search when TimeDance went under. Instead,
she took a few months off to plan a Sept. 23 wedding in Philadelphia.
"It is a part of your life that is only going to happen one time,"
says Leone, 26. "It's nice to be able to spend the time it deserves."
Leone's thoughts often drift to what comes after the honeymoon
in Hawaii. But she only has time to think between dress fittings
with each of her eight bridesmaids, meetings with the caterer,
band leader and photographer, and ballroom dancing lessons with
her fiance, Rich Riley, a business development director
at Yahoo.
"Everything now is building momentum to this big event," says
Leone, a University of Pennsylvania grad. "Then I think, 'What's
going to happen when I go back to San Francisco?' There's that
big empty abyss which I just try not to worry about."
Looking back on the past two years, Leone marvels at how she made
the transition from high school English teacher in Springfield
Township, Pa., to co-founder of a Silicon Valley start-up.
"So often I've been somebody who reads about things," Leone
says. "It's very, very bizarre to me to be in the midst of it."
She's not sure what she'll do next. She took six courses toward
a Ph.D. in secondary school administration and could go back to
school. She has written seven chapters of a fictional story about
a woman's first year teaching. Or, she thinks, she might look
for another job in Net marketing.
"My experience in Internet marketing, professionally, was just
beginning," she says. "I had a great future ahead of me at TimeDance,
and I was really looking forward to seeing what it would develop
into."
Now, she adds, "There's nothing left of the two companies to
point to and say 'Look what we did.' "
New Vectiv hire retains his dreams of striking it rich
Eric Fain found himself out of a job just four months after he
loaded his life into a moving van and quit his job as a Web developer
at a Dallas subsidiary of First American Financial.
He gave himself two weeks before beginning another job search.
He posted his resume on online job boards Monster.com
and Dice.com, noting that he was seeking a "pre-IPO start-up"
in San Francisco.
For Fain, the lure of a start-up, with the potential for a "big
payoff" is still there. But he knows the odds are growing remote.
With companies likeTimeDance dying, many employees are trading
their dreams of striking it rich for worries of surviving the
Darwinian shakeout.
Still, the 32-year-old figures, "I'm single. If I'm going to
do it, I might as well do it now."
In a few days, Fain received 40 e-mails and calls from recruiters.
His first interview was at Quokka Sports, a Web site that provides
sports news, information, shopping and live event coverage.
"I'm not sure how strong their company really is," he says.
"I have some trepidation as to how they will realistically make
money."
Did he consider those issues when he interviewed at TimeDance
four months ago? "I definitely asked those questions, but it
didn't seem as pressing then," he says. He recalls a favorite
joke of TimeDance CEO Mark Lazar: URL is an acronym for 'Ubiquity
now, Revenue Later.'
Fain also interviewed at Vectiv, a start-up that wants to provide
Web-based software to help companies choose and manage real estate
acquisitions, and AvantGo, which helps people to view Internet
and other information on mobile devices.
Eight days after starting his job search, Fain receives his first
offer from Vectiv. A few days later, he accepts the offer, becoming
Vectiv's 12th employee.
Fain settles into a cubicle with a jaw-dropping view from the
20-foot windows next to his desk: to his left, the San Francisco
skyline; straight ahead, the Bay Bridge; and to the right, the
new Giants ballpark. He works at his laptop here, building and
testing Vectiv's new product, which is due out at the end of this
month.
Occasionally, Fain wonders if Vectiv will be the next big thing,
or if it could suffer the same fate as TimeDance.
"You always run the risk that Microsoft is going to roll over
and inadvertently squash your company," he says.

Race issues shake tech world What looks like meritocracy can brim with bias, experts say as more lawsuits are filed

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The ugly images seem incongruous with the
highflying, high-tech world often touted as the ultimate meritocracy,
where talent counts more than skin color.
But racial discrimination appears to have found a home there,
too, minority employees contend. Consider these racial discrimination
lawsuits and complaints filed with state and federal agencies:
* At 3Com, a veteran telecommunications manager who is
black was shunned by his bosses and given a desk alone in a chilly
backroom with computer equipment. The day after his lawyer called
the company to request a mediation meeting, he was fired.
* At NEC Electronics, a white manager waved a 6-foot bullwhip
at meetings, confiding to a colleague that she used it to keep
black employees in line, according to former NEC workers. White
managers at the company frequently spewed racial slurs, legal
filings allege.
* At Oracle, a seasoned manager, who is Hispanic, was allegedly
berated by her bosses and given minor tasks, from fetching coffee
to typing name tags. After she was fired, it took months of therapy
for her to regain her confidence.
More than a generation after the civil-rights movement swept the
nation, legal and diversity experts contend the technology field
is troubled by racist, hostile workplaces and blatant discrimination
in the hiring and promotion of African-Americans and Hispanics.
"Clearly, (racial) discrimination is still a problem in the workplace,
and technology is no exception," says Angela Alioto, a San Francisco
attorney representing former employees suing NEC for discrimination
and retaliation.
A major study last year of 250 Silicon Valley firms employing
142,000 workers found that 4% were black and 8% were Hispanic,
reports John Templeton, co-founder of the Coalition for Fair Employment
in Silicon Valley. In the San Francisco Bay Area, blacks and Hispanics
make up 8% and 14% of the workforce, the Labor Department finds.
"Our patience has worn thin," Templeton says. "It's unconscionable
that their (hiring) numbers are so ridiculously low."
A groundswell of legal and political activity on the issue of
discrimination has spread nationwide to gleaming technology parks
and corporate campuses:
* In recent months, high-tech firms have been hit with
dozens of lawsuits and complaints alleging racial discrimination.
In the largest case, dozens of an expected 300 current and former
employees of Nextel Communications have filed complaints with
the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, charging racial
and sexual discrimination. Nextel has declined comment until the
firm completes its investigation.
Class-action law firms are hungry to sign on technology workers
who feel they've suffered from racism. "This may well be the
next hot area for class actions," says Steve Sidener, a lawyer
at Gold Bennett Cera & Sidener in San Francisco.
* The political heat is rising in the high-tech, anti-discrimination
arena. On Saturday, 100 people filled Emmanuel Baptist Church
here for a workplace-rights seminar sponsored by the Coalition
for Fair Employment, the NAACP and the EEOC. Minority workers
in business attire shed a few tears and shared tales of anger
about slamming into the glass ceiling at their Silicon Valley
companies.
On Capitol Hill, the National Urban League and other black leaders
are fighting the government's plans to double to 200,000 the number
of H-1B visas for high-tech foreign workers. They argue that technology
firms seeking to hire immigrants are ignoring well-qualified blacks
and Hispanics at home. According to the Labor Department, there
are 583,000 black and Hispanic engineers, computer scientists
and technicians in the United States.
Activist Jesse Jackson and his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition continue
to lobby for more hiring and training of blacks and Hispanics.
In recent visits to Silicon Valley, Jackson has met with Cisco
Systems CEO John Chambers, Intel CEO Craig Barrett, Hewlett-Packard
CEO Carly Fiorina and other power brokers.
* The EEOC is on the prowl. Criticized as a paper tiger
in the high-tech field, the EEOC appears to be hunting more closely
for workplace discrimination in Silicon Valley. The agency recently
beefed up its San Francisco district office, nearly doubling its
staff to 50 investigators and lawyers.
David Grinberg, an EEOC spokesman, denies it is targeting technology
firms and says it investigates discrimination claims in all industries.
But employment-law attorneys and government regulators say privately
that race and age discrimination complaints by high-tech workers
are slowly rising. And, as it does in other industries, the EEOC
hopes to "send a message" by taking on a large Silicon Valley
firm or two.
Are claims 'absurd'?
High-tech boosters hail their industry as one where vision and
hard work are richly rewarded, regardless of race or ethnicity.
Given the critical shortage of technology workers, anyone who
can write software code can land a good job, they argue. "Sure,
there are individual cases of discrimination, but to claim there's
widespread racial bias in our industry is just absurd," says
T.J. Rodgers, CEO of Cypress Semiconductor in San Jose and an
outspoken critic of affirmative action.
Industry cheerleaders also point to the many firms -- Cisco, IBM,
Gateway, Applied Materials and others -- that work hard on the
digital divide issue. They fund scholarships for thousands of
minorities and give money and computers to inner-city schools
and training projects. They note that groups including the Society
of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the National Society of
Black Engineers are working more closely with high-tech firms
on recruiting, training and other issues. "We're making progress,
but a lot more needs to be done," says Leticia Vidal, executive
director of the Hispanic engineers' group in Los Angeles.
But critics say that companies also must deal with racial attitudes
deeply embedded in corporate cultures and managers. "Silicon
Valley prides itself on being a unique meritocracy, but of course
there's discrimination there just as there is in every other industry,"
says Butch Wing, a spokesman for the Rainbow/PUSH coalition.
A shocking dismissal
Lindsay Brown, a tall, friendly man from Sioux City, Iowa, speaks
proudly of his career accomplishments and his family. Before joining
3Com in 1998, he had worked 25 years for IBM, Rolm and Siemens
as a telecommunications manager.
At 3Com, he was hired as a telecom analyst and promised management
duties and training. He was told he would be a valued member of
the team. Instead, he was ignored and given menial tasks, according
to Brown; his attorney, Doris Nehme; and state legal records.
He was not invited to project meetings. He was reprimanded for
taking time off for his stepmother's funeral and another family
emergency, even though bosses had approved the days off. He was
shunted to work alone at a desk in a cold computer room although
there was space in the main office, according to the filing.
Last August, Brown strolled into work and tried unsuccessfully
to log on to his computer. A few minutes later, a shocked Brown
was told by his bosses that he had been fired.
"I felt humiliated," says Brown, speaking at his three-bedroom
ranch home in Sunnyvale. "I had never heard of anyone else at
3Com being treated this way."
Brown hired an attorney and filed a complaint with the California
Fair Employment and Housing Department, alleging discrimination,
retaliation and harassment by four bosses at 3Com. He also requested
right-to-sue notices to clear the way for a civil lawsuit.
Todd Irwin, a 3Com spokesman, denies that Brown was the target
of discriminatory treatment. In a written statement, 3Com says
Brown was fired "after careful consideration of his performance
and after repeated written and verbal warnings. 3Com does not
discriminate. Our culture and values as a company are so strongly
supportive of respecting diversity, we are confident anyone who
knows our company will know this is an inaccurate charge."
3Com declined to release the racial breakdown of its staff, but
Labor Department data from 1996 show that 3% of its 3,800 employees
were black, 6% Hispanic and 20% Asian. About 14% of its managers
were minorities.
Brown and his lawyer say they plan to sue in federal court soon.
Brown, who is unemployed, estimates the firing cost him $ 100,000
in lost salary, benefits and stock options. "I do not want to
use race as a crutch, but I had to fight this," Brown says. "My
mother was a devout Baptist, and she taught us the ethos of hard
work. She also taught us to stand our ground if we believe we're
right."
Passed over for promotion
For two decades, Eugene Shands, a burly former Marine, toiled
first as a cop and an assistant dean of students at University
of California at Santa Barbara, then as a security manager at
Amdahl. When he landed a plum job as NEC's security director in
1990, he thought he would retire at the San Jose company.
But problems started surfacing. Nearly every day at NEC's offices
and warehouses, white managers and employees uttered racial and
sexual slurs, including many that are too vulgar to be published
here, according to lawsuits. Despite his experience and glowing
job reviews, Shands -- who is black and Hispanic -- was passed
over several times for promotions by whites with less experience,
the lawsuits say.
The most startling incidents involved a former warehouse manager
who kept a bullwhip in her office, former NEC workers say. She
strode across the warehouse snapping the whip; she took it to
staff meetings. "Get to work!" she yelled. When Shands asked
her why she had it, he says she replied, "To keep my colored
boys in line. That's what they understand." Shands, who was mailed
the whip anonymously, says, "I couldn't believe this manager
was saying these things."
Mark Pearce, an NEC spokesman, declined to address the
allegations but confirmed the problem with the manager's bullwhip.
"It's true that several years ago, we had a serious but isolated
situation in the company. We carried out a thorough, independent
investigation and took decisive, responsible action."
The manager and another supervisor were fired after NEC's investigation,
according to the lawsuits. The manager could not be reached for
comment. But the racial slurs continued. Shands also alleged that
his new NEC boss undercut his authority, piled on impossible work
assignments and set him up for failure.
Shands lodged a complaint with the EEOC in 1997. A month later,
he was fired. NEC accused him of falsifying his resume
with bogus police and educational credentials. Shands showed USA
TODAY original documents and certificates corroborating his credentials.
After months of receiving treatment for depression, Shands wants
his day in court. He has sued NEC in federal court for racial
discrimination, breach of contract and retaliation. NEC's Pearce
declines to comment on the lawsuit. He says that NEC -- a Japanese-owned
company based in Tokyo -- is a "mini-United Nations" that trains
employees to respect different cultures. Managers who engage in
discriminatory actions are disciplined appropriately, he says.
That doesn't appease Shands. "I'm still angry. I had a pretty
good reputation in this Valley. Now it's at rock bottom. I want
a jury to hear my story."
From a bonus to being fired
Maria Flores, a Honduran woman who was born in a Central American
fishing village and raised in New York City, was hired in 1996
by Oracle after 15 years at IBM as a technical trainer and sales
manager.
Developing training programs for salespeople, Flores did well
her first year. She got a big raise, a bonus and a glowing performance
review, according to her legal documents. During a corporate reshuffling
the next year, Flores ended up with a new boss. Suddenly, Flores
could do no right. According to her EEOC complaint and lawsuit
against Oracle, she was given menial tasks, such as sharpening
pencils. She says she was made the scapegoat of a poorly conceived
project that flopped. And while eight white colleagues on her
team with less experience were promoted, Flores alleges that she
was "criticized, belittled and treated differently from non-minority
employees."
In December 1997, her manager wrote up Flores and told her she
needed to improve her performance. A month later, Oracle fired
her. In court filings, Oracle's law firm, Keesal Young & Logan,
deny the charges raised by Flores. A statement from Oracle also
says Flores' allegations are "without any merit." Flores was
hired over two white job applicants, the statement reads, and
the actions taken against her "were in no way based on her race
or ancestry."
Oracle says the company enjoys a reputation as one of the best
high-tech companies on diversity issues. Oracle actively recruits
minorities, sponsors dozens of minority career conferences and
recently donated $ 700,000 to the United Negro College Fund.
The fast-growing firm also appears to have hired more minorities
in recent years. In 1996, minorities made up 26% of its workforce
of 12,000 and 9% of its managers, according to the Labor Department.
Today, 32% of its workforce of 44,000 and 25% of its managers
are minorities, Oracle says.
Flores still was devastated by her firing. She sought comfort
from friends and a counselor. She flew to Honduras for a month,
visiting relatives in the fishing village and taking long walks
with her elderly father.
"After all of my hard work, I did not deserve to be treated so
shabbily by Oracle," she says. "They had no legal or moral right
to deny me the fruits of my labor."

Germany looks outside to fill high-tech jobs
USA TODAY

FINAL EDITION

BERLIN -- Germany's government will begin issuing U.S.-style work
permits in August to foreign computer experts who want to move
here. But already Germany is struggling to accept that to compete
in the world, it might need to make it easier for non-Germans
to become citizens.
"This really has started a serious debate about immigration policies,"
says Axel Zerdick, a technology professor in Berlin. "We are
on the right way there."
Germany is well-known for world-class engineering that has produced
Mercedes-Benz and BMW automobiles, but it has been caught off-guard
by the explosion in information technology.
German companies say they need more database programmers, Web
page designers and experts in Internet software. Major corporations
have scrambled to the government for help from outsiders.
To answer the demands of corporations such as automaker DaimlerChrysler
and Siemens electrical engineering and electronics company, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has pushed through a program for
temporarily admitting up to 20,000 foreign technology workers
this year.
That won't come close to filling all the vacancies, companies
say, but it will help ease the pressure.
Workers from other European Union countries don't need the permits.
But those countries have their own shortages in high-skilled labor
and can't fill the gap in Germany. So German industry is looking
to India and the Far East.
That concept is proving difficult for Germans to accept, especially
when unemployment is just under 10%, more than twice the U.S.
rate. Schroeder has promised to attack joblessness, which remains
stubbornly high despite an otherwise strong economy.
Joblessness is particularly high in the former East Germany, where
there are pockets of unemployment 20% or higher.
So filling jobs with foreigners, even if they are jobs for which
Germans don't qualify, has struck a national nerve. Jokes abound.
One radio station in Berlin occasionally halts its programming,
then delivers an announcement: "Our server is down. Sahib, come
quick!"
But others won't dismiss it with a joke. "Kinder statt Inder"
or "Children, not Indians," is the slogan of unions and conservatives
who say the government should train Germans for these jobs.
Meanwhile, some of the best available help doesn't want to come
to a country well- known for its hatred of foreigners.
"The German people are thinking, 'the foreign people are coming
to get our jobs,' " says Uzay Mericten, 30, a computer expert
in Frankfurt. Mericten moved from Turkey to Germany with his parents
when he was 3 years old.
Importing workers is nothing new to Germany.
To ease a worker shortage in WWII, a booming Germany in the 1950s
opened its doors to gastarbeiters, or "guest workers,"
from Turkey and Eastern Europe. They were given jobs but still
considered outsiders.
More than 7 million foreigners live in Germany today. But they
don't have the rights of German citizens and have frequently been
targeted for harassment or worse by right-wing "skinheads."
Such anti-immigrant activity has not gone unnoticed by prospective
workers abroad. Indians who met with German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer on his recent trip to Bangalore, India, said Germany was
a hostile place for them. They said that German landlords won't
rent to Indians and that Indians were mistreated by German police,
according to an account in the newspaper Berliner Morgenpost.
Many Germans say that such fears are justified. An Indian "would
be beaten up, just walking across the street" before his 5-year
work permit is up, Zerdick says. "They know. Those who have been
in Germany usually say they would prefer the U.S. We do not have
an Indian community here."
The reason Germany lacks minority communities is that it permits
almost no immigration. Even the new permits, known here as "green
cards," will not be like green cards in the United States that
promise permanency.
The program is more comparable to the USA's H-1B visa program,
which speeds up temporary entry for qualified workers. Congress
is considering expanding that program to admit up to 200,000 information
technology workers to the United States. That added competition
for the world's tech workers would make it even harder for Germany
to recruit.
Overcoming foreigners' reluctance to come here will challenge
German industry.
"You must build up a brand where the potential employees are
associating some attractiveness," says Alexander Fink, with Debis
AG, an information technology spinoff of DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart.
"You have to have some very intelligent ways of recruiting."
At Siemens in Berlin, spokesman Enzio Kuhlmann-Stumm says the
green cards will cut through some paperwork. But his company did
not wait for the government; even under cumbersome rules that
now exist, it has moved overseas employees to Germany.
And it is contracting out work to foreign firms.
"If you go here through the aisles and look at the names on the
doors, there are very exotic names already," he says. But Germany
also needs to offer citizenship. "We have to realize that we
need qualified immigration."
The green card program will bring some workers. But without the
promise of citizenship for the workers and their families, keeping
them will be hard.
At the beginning of this year, Germany eased slightly what had
been the strictest immigration policy in the world.
It allows foreigners living here to apply for dual citizenship
after eight years, three years longer than the maximum under the
new green card program.
It also allowed for the first time children born in Germany of
foreign parents to later choose German citizenship, so long as
one parent has lived in Germany.
But making Germany attractive will take more than government decrees.
Mericten could stay. Instead he has applied for a green card from
the United States.
"I want to get a new environment, a new culture, meet people
and get a warm place to work," he says.
Does he consider all Germans cold? Not necessarily, he said, just
the weather. And the government can't change that either, he says.

Candidates toss a mud pie in S.C.'s smiling faces

CHARLESTON, S.C. -- In a down-to-the-wire political campaign,
there is a stage beyond nail-biting, white-knuckle tension. That's
when the race is so tight that leading proponents for both sides
sound terminally depressed as they envision their man's impending
defeat. So it is for the dispirited backers of both George W.
Bush and John McCain in this Saturday's right-wing-and-a-prayer
South Carolina Republican primary.
The gloomy mood came after a week in which both candidates went
through a conversion experience akin to vegetarians pigging out
at an all-you-can-eat barbecue. Ignoring their pious pledges of
positive politics, they went after each other with Al-Gore-esque
ferocity. In heavy-handed TV ads, Bush implied that his rival
was a campaign-reform hypocrite because of his ties to lobbyists,
while McCain directly compared the Texas governor's slipperiness
to that of Bill Clinton. The title of a McCain press release,
albeit one-sided, conveyed the high-minded tone: "Bush Unloads
the Gutters on McCain."
Supporters of the two contenders were shell-shocked after their
candidates became nattering nabobs of negativism. Richard Quinn,
a local political consultant helping direct the McCain campaign,
said nervously: "Something amazing is being born here. The only
question is whether the carpet bombing by the Bush campaign will
kill it."
Meanwhile, former Charleston-area congressman Tommy Hartnett,
who ran the winning primary campaign here for George Bush in 1988
and is an ardent backer of the ex-president's son, confessed,
"I'm dumbstruck by McCain's rise. I'm sick over the whole thing.
I'm really concerned." That said, Hartnett questioned Bush's
reliance on negative ads: "When you're running against an underdog
who's also a war hero, why attack him?"
Many leading Bush supporters here, who had endorsed the Texas
governor after being beguiled by his magnetism and intensity in
small meetings, are puzzled by why it took the candidate so long
to display his personal charm for South Carolina voters. As Bobby
Harrell, the influential chairman of the Ways and Means Committee
in the state House, put it, "We believe that Gov. Bush should
play to his strength and get out and talk to people."
That's the new Bush strategy, described on campaign banners as
"One on One with Gov. Bush," which was on display Saturday at
a lunchtime rally at the Orangeburg fairgrounds. No longer was
the candidate surrounded by enough local officials to fill an
inaugural ball. But Bush's handlers were uneasy about sending
him out entirely without props, so he stood between two enormous
John Deere tractors and four bales of hay. (Fashion note: This
may have been billed as Dubbya Unplugged, but the candidate spoke
in a barn for more than an hour with his gray suit coat tightly
buttoned.)
As Bush answered questions on everything from home schooling to
Russia, he displayed a fluency with policy details that would
surprise his critics. Moving seamlessly from the Nunn-Lugar Act
to H-1-B visas, he repeatedly apologized for the length of his
answers and then went on to show all he knew. The crowd was friendly
and supportive, but there was little of the passion seen recently
in South Carolina at McCain events.
The session, which ended well before 2 p.m., was Bush's last South
Carolina appearance of the weekend. He immediately flew home to
Austin, Texas. In Columbia, S.C., earlier Saturday, the candidate
was overheard by a C-SPAN microphone saying, "I'm going back
to sleep in my own bed and see my girls." While not minimizing
the allure of a firm mattress and a family visit, it did seem
like a self-indulgent schedule for a candidate desperate to prove
that he's willing to earn the nomination by scrapping for every
last vote.
For McCain in South Carolina, the challenge lies not in arousing
voter intensity but in maintaining it. What is an insurgent candidate
to do once the halo-like glow from his incandescent performance
in the New Hampshire primary begins to fade? The Arizona senator
virtually admitted that he made a tactical error with his harsh
anti-Bush ads. He pulled them off the air and replaced them with
spots emphasizing his crusade against "the special interests."
McCain, for all his positive press clippings, is discovering daily
the different standards to which reformers are held. A front-page
headline Sunday in Charleston's Post and Courier blared,
"McCain money linked to alcohol, gambling." Citing figures provided
by the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan group that
tracks money in politics, the article refers to $ 64,000 that McCain
has raised from casino interests and $ 24,000 from beer distributors.
Missing from the story, though, is a sense of proportion: The
money was less than 0.5% of what McCain raised in 1999. Compared
with so-well-funded-he-doesn't-choose-to-abide-by-spending-limits
Bush, McCain is relatively free of the taint of big money.
In contrast to New Hampshire's muscular "Live Free or Die,"
South Carolina's license-plate motto is saccharine: "Smiling
Faces, Beautiful Places." Given the tempo of the GOP primary
campaign, many of those faces will be snarling by Saturday.

Bush pitches to Silicon Valley

Hoping to win the votes -- and wallets -- of Silicon Valley, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush will lay out a set of high-tech positions
today that he says would keep government from stifling the nation's
most dynamic economic sector.
At a breakfast fund-raiser in Palo Alto, part of a three-day swing
through California, Bush will call for maintaining the federal
moratorium on Internet taxes and letting more high-skilled foreign
workers into the United States.
Bush's aim is to convince Silicon Valley executives that he is
as tech-savvy as Vice President Gore but more supportive of their
issues than the vice president is.
"As president, (Bush) will work to prevent the long arm of government
from interfering in cyberspace," says a fact sheet issued by
the Republican front-runner's campaign.
In his speech, a copy of which was obtained by USA TODAY, Bush
also will call for:
* Keeping the Internet free of tariffs worldwide.
* Relaxing federal export controls on items such as high-performance
computers and powerful data-encryption software. U.S. computer
industry executives complain that such controls bar them from
selling technology widely available from other countries.
* Passage of a permanent tax credit for research and development,
a benefit worth about $ 2.5 billion a year to companies. Currently,
the credit requires annual congressional approval.
Bush had also intended to make a big issue of lawsuits related
to the Year 2000 computer bug known as Y2K. He planned to accuse
the White House of being in the pockets of trial lawyers by threatening
to veto a bill the industry has sought to limit its liability.
Tuesday, however, President Clinton and Congress struck a tentative
compromise, removing it as a point of contention for Bush. "I
am pleased that the president changed his mind," Bush said Wednesday
in Los Angeles. "I just hope the vice president supports his
decision."
Bush and Gore will still be able to debate the number of temporary
programmers and other high-tech workers companies can hire from
abroad under "H-1B" visas. This year's limit is 115,000, but
Bush wants the cap raised to about 160,000 to accommodate all
the pending company requests. The Clinton administration and organized
labor have previously resisted raising the limit.
The moratorium on Internet taxes, which Gore also supports, will
remain in place while a federal advisory commission studies whether
on-line commerce should be subject to sales tax.

High-tech worker visa bill blocked

The unraveling of a bill to let more high-tech workers into the
USA is rekindling debate over the country's skilled labor shortage.
The bill that would have nearly doubled visas for skilled foreign
workers was blocked Friday by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who questioned
the extent of the labor crunch.
The move stunned supporters, who now hope the bill that sailed
through the House still can be revived or rolled into other legislation
this session.
"Unless there are people who think high tech is a fad, we're
going to see an increase in demand (for) high-tech workers,"
says Lowell Sachs at Sun Microsystems.
But critics point to recent high-tech industry layoffs, suggesting
the skilled-worker shortage is largely hype.
"There's no reason American workers shouldn't fill these high-tech
jobs," says Patrick Dorton, a Harkin spokesman.
The number of H-1B visas, which are open to highly skilled foreign
professionals, is limited to 65,000 annually. They're valid for
up to three years, but can be renewed up to six years.
The bill would raise that number to 115,000 visas for the next
two years, with 107,500 visas available in 2001.
High-tech employers now are on the defensive, bristling at claims
they hire foreign workers because they cost less.
"It's actually more expensive to bring them over," says Jim
Cullinan at Microsoft, adding the firm has about 3,000 jobs to
fill.
They say recent job cutbacks rarely include the highly educated
professionals that Silicon Valley employers covet.
"The sentiment that we're giving out pink slips while saying
we don't have enough foreign workers is just a distorted view,"
says Jenifer Eisen at Intel, which this year announced it will
cut 5% of its workforce.
Employers say they invest millions of dollars in training U.S.
employees even though they also need foreign workers.
But critics maintain the system is flawed.
Since those with H1-B visas have corporate sponsorship, some say
high-tech employers really just want employees who stick around.
"It's slavery light," says Mark Krikorian, executive director
of the Center for Immigration Studies. "They're indentured servants.
They get people who can't job hop."
Another 65,000 new visas were made available Oct. 1, but experts
say they could be used up as early as January.
Efforts now are under way to revive the bill, with supporters
in contact with the White House and senators.

High-tech firms hope for higher cap on worker visas

Electronics engineer Mahesh Maddury got in just in time. His application
for an H-1B or "temporary skilled worker" visa was approved
in April, just two weeks before the annual limit of 65,000 was
reached.
"I would have had to go back to India," Maddury says, where
jobs that take advantage of his training are scarce, and computer
and electronics professionals earn around $ 3,600 a year vs. an
average $ 60,000 in the USA.
Maddury, who received a master's degree in electrical engineering
at the University of Colorado this year, now works on communications
equipment.
But hundreds of other foreign applicants weren't so lucky and
were forced to return to their home countries. If the high-tech
industry gets its wish, lawmakers will vote this week to lift
the limit on the number of visas for skilled workers that get
approved each year. Indian applicants could benefit most.
Executives in the software and semiconductor industries say India's
schools are turning out some of the top engineering talent in
the world.
Those graduates are needed, companies say, to meet a critical
shortage of workers in the information technology industry. Intel,
the world's leading chipmaker, hires more foreign workers from
India than anywhere else because their grades often place them
among the top 15% of U.S. college students.
Some 11% of bachelor's degrees, 42% of master's and 48% of doctorates
in computer engineering fields awarded by U.S. colleges go to
foreign nationals, according to the American Electronics Association.
And that's how foreign workers end up being hired by U.S. companies.
Only a few businesses recruit overseas for domestic jobs.
Silicon Valley companies complain that the visa limit hurts their
ability to operate. They say that more than 300,000 technology-related
jobs are going begging because there are not enough computer professionals
in the USA to fill them.
"Even the entry-level positions in our factories require a two-year
college degree in applied science with a pretty heavy emphasis
on technical physics and chemistry," says Intel Vice President
Tracy Koon.
"This limit undermines the ability of Microsoft and other companies
to supplement our U.S. workforce with highly skilled personnel
from overseas when people with such qualifications aren't available
here," Microsoft's Mike Murray said in an April op-ed article
in USA TODAY.
In Congress, technology companies have lobbied for legislation
to increase the foreign skilled worker immigration cap to 115,000
per year in 2002. But the Clinton administration says steps in
the bill to prevent companies from hiring foreign workers over
similarly qualified U.S. residents fall short.
Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and other technology companies are working
with community colleges and other schools to improve the quality
of science and math education and to encourage students -- especially
women and minorities -- to enter engineering programs.
It's not enough, says Robert Gnaizda, policy director of the Greenlining
Institute, a San Francisco coalition that promotes corporate social
responsibility.
"We favor liberal immigration laws," Gnaizda says. "Indians
should have the right to take jobs here. But before we do that,
there should be a plan for closing the digital divide" that keeps
blacks and Hispanics out of Silicon Valley jobs.
According to Gnaizda, Intel, one of the Valley's largest employers,
has 84% white managers, 5% Latino and 2% black. The San Francisco
Bay-area workforce has 14% Latinos and 8% blacks.
"It's not prejudice. I think it's indifference," says Gnaizda,
a veteran of workers rights efforts such as the unionization of
farm workers. "If the resource comes to them fully wrapped, they'll
buy it."
Indian workers, however, say they, too, face challenges in the
boardrooms and on the campuses that dot Silicon Valley.
They are dependent on help from their employers in obtaining H-1B
visas and eventually a "green card" denoting permanent resident
alien status -- a situation that makes them especially vulnerable
to exploitation, say some labor advocates.
They also are often financially tied to the employers -- unable
to move to new, higher-paying jobs at other companies unless they
get a new work visa and pay a hefty penalty to their original
employer.
Discrimination, while rare, still exists.
"People look at me and ask what kind of visa do I have," says
Perminder Tumber, an Indian-American engineer at Samsung, "I've
been a citizen for 20 years."
"The discrimination is subtle," Dipak Pallana says. "If you
are an Anglo, your chance of getting in is much easier."
However, as the number of successful Indian immigrants here grows,
so does their stature.
"If anything, (having an Indian name) is positive," says Ami
Mehta, a marketing executive at Hewlett-Packard. "There's definitely
an 'old boys network,' but some of the old boys are from India."
Mehta and others say that the prevalence of engineers from India
leads people to presume that anyone from India in Silicon Valley
is an engineer. "But at the end of the day, you still need to
produce," says Samir Master, a physician who now is a venture
capitalist with Comdisco Ventures. His parents emigrated from
India and he grew up in Iowa.
Indeed, many immigrants say the emphasis on intellectual ability
more often than not levels the playing field.
A Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities report finds that
some foreign high-tech workers get premium wages because their
skills exceed those of other workers.
"There is a lot of criticism of these as temporary, cheap workers,
and they are neither," Koon says.
The desire to fit in is one factor that drives many engineers
who come here from India into the same neighborhoods and the same
apartment complexes. There are many Indian stores and restaurants
in Sunnyvale, near homes where many from India live. Across the
San Francisco Bay in Fremont, it's much the same.
"There's a need to be where other Indians live," says Yoghesh
Sharma, editor of SiliconIndia magazine. "I have to buy
my spices, my pickles and my mangoes -- you can't get these in
Palo Alto or Redwood City," where the Silicon Valley elite live.
"Here, the CEO and the engineer are bumper to bumper."
Ashutosh Roy, who is moving to a larger apartment within his largely
Indian neighborhood, says most of the segregation is by choice
and pertains only to home life. "Part of the congregation of
taste and preference comes from the initial requirement to make
a lot of decisions. It's a lot easier."

Geek shortage? Naw, just tight market

If Julian Simon were alive today, he'd have a pretty good laugh
at the current frenzy of fear about a perceived shortage of high-tech
workers.
Over the past several months the Commerce Department has called
the shortage "America's new deficit." The Information Technology
Association of America (ITAA) ominously reports that 346,000 high-tech
jobs linger unfilled, and Vice President Al Gore has anxiously
prophesied that the shortage of high-tech workers could cripple
America's future competitiveness.
Simon, who died earlier this year, would have found all of this
scaremongering funny, familiar and misguided because more than
20 years ago, he predicted just such a scenario.
In 1980, Simon published a book titled The Ultimate Resource,
where he explained in exhaustive detail with hundreds of charts
and tables that essentially all natural resources were becoming
"more" abundant, not scarce. He proved this somewhat counterintuitive
thesis by showing how even as the demand might increase for things
such as oil and copper the known natural reserves of these resources
keeps increasing and our ability to harvest those reserves keeps
improving. Consequently, in one diagram after another, Simon showed
that the cost of most natural resources has been coming down for
decades and centuries.
The one resource Simon was convinced was not becoming more abundant
the ultimate resource was human ingenuity. Throughout his life,
Simon had advocated the idea that well-educated, highly skilled
people were the most valuable asset any company or country could
acquire and, therefore, would always be in enormous demand.
For example, over the past 25 years the number of college graduates
in America has roughly doubled and yet wages for those same college
graduates steadily have gone up. In economic terms, the supply
of college grads has gone up dramatically and yet demand for their
skills has increased at an even faster pace.
Consequently, the notion of a high-tech "worker shortage" is
simply silly. As long as we use the phrase "shortage" we invite
the notion that somehow an increased supply of geeks will eliminate
the roaring demand. There always will be robust demand for programmers,
engineers and scientists, and nothing is likely to change that
situtation.
A more accurate description is that we have a tight labor market
for infotech workers, and unemployment in their professions is
extremely low. Even if the ITAA's suspiciously self-serving statistic
of 346,000 job openings were miraculously filled tomorrow, next
week there would still be new high-tech help-wanted listings.
A shortage is a temporary problem, a tight labor market in a dynamic
growing economy can remain in perpetuity.
Once you accept that the geek-shortage is a permanent state of
affairs, then it becomes clear that economic competition in an
information economy is essentially a battle for brains and the
countries with the most well-educated people win. We can import
brains and we can nurture brains but we can never have too many.
The Clinton administration has proposed a series of piddling initiatives
to combat the geek-scarcity that include increased funding for
school-to-work programs, a marketing campaign promoting high-tech
careers, and training for dislocated workers. None of these programs
is likely to have any impact, but there are three things that
America can do to increase the number of high-skilled staff, mainly
by easing the state and federal regulations on immigration, education
and commerce.
First, the federal government should dramatically increase the
number of H1B visas that allow brainiac immigrants to work in
the United States. As Simon noted over the years, high-skilled
workers from other countries are a bargain. They create jobs,
pay taxes and use fewer government services than natives. Concerns
expressed by officials like Sens. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., and
Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., that allowing in too many well-educated
immigrants will depress wages for Americans are flat out wrong
as economists like Simon and others have repeatedly shown.
Second, our public education system fails an unconscionably large
number of children and is badly in need of more choice and competition.
State-level initiatives like charter schools, which allow publicly
funded schools to operate with more autonomy from burdensome bureaucracies,
can significantly increase the number of kids who successfully
get high school and college diplomas and therefore participate
fully in the information economy.
Finally, the best enticements for a career in high-tech are the
riches showering down on computer and Internet-focused entrepreneurs.
Bill Gates and his billions probably have done more to make people
aware of the opportunities in high technology than any trifling
government-sponsored advertising campaign ever will.
Sadly, the government seems committed to undermining even that
process by demonizing Gates in its recent anti-trust efforts.
Technology and software firms have been among the most innovative
and productive sectors of the economy, and critical to that success
has been the freedom to operate without interference from the
likes of the Justice or Commerce Departments.
As Simon wrote not long before his death: "The growth of population
and of income create actual and expected shortages, and hence
lead to price run-ups. A price increase represents an opportunity
that attracts profit-minded entrepreneurs to seek new ways to
satisfy the shortages. Some fail, at cost to themselves. A few
succeed, and the result is that we end up better off than if the
original shortages had never arisen."

Claims of high-tech worker shortage don't compute

Early this year, the high-tech industry made a worrisome announcement.
It is plagued by chronic shortages of skilled workers, so much
so that three-quarters of a million tech jobs are going begging.
The industry -- no, the entire economy -- hangs in the balance
if nothing is done.
The public ate it up. And President Clinton sprang into action,
quickly putting together a $ 28 million package to help attract
and train the next generation of computer geeks.
What's really going on is an old Washington game: An industry
plays Chicken Little while holding its cup out for special favors.
While some firms no doubt have trouble hiring people right now
-- and who doesn't these days, with unemployment at 30-year lows
-- claims of a widespread, grave lack of brainiacs in America
just don't add up.
Economics 101 says that when something is in short supply, its
price gets bid up until enough suppliers come in to meet the demand.
Mysteriously, that hasn't been happening in the high-tech world.
Real wages essentially have tracked those for other professional
specialty occupations, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Also, companies continue to be very picky about whom they hire.
A report out of the University of California at Davis found that
high-tech employers generally hire only about 2% of those applying
for programmer jobs. That's hardly what you'd expect from firms
claiming to be making a hopeless search for anyone with skills
to do the job.
The industry also fails to note that enrollment in computer majors
has skyrocketed in the past two years.
What high-tech executives seem to be after is a steady source
of relatively cheap labor. And they've found a ready supply through
an immigration program that goes by the name of H-1B. The program,
set up in 1989, was designed to let U.S. firms meet emergency,
temporary skilled-worker needs if no Americans fit the bill. The
annual cap on these visas is set at 65,000.
The problem is, the tech industry seems addicted to it -- applying
is easy, and enforcement is lax. So applications have skyrocketed
in recent years, and the tech lobby is pushing hard to get lawmakers
to nearly double the cap. Claiming a severe shortage of U.S. workers
is a pretty good ploy to make it so.
Industry officials say they're just searching the planet for the
best and the brightest. But the vast bulk of H-1B workers earn
around $ 50,000 -- not exactly a premium price for top talent.
Worse, a Labor Department study found widespread abuses of the
program. In some cases, U.S. workers had to train their H-1B replacements
-- a clear violation of the program's intent.
The sky isn't falling on the technology industry. There are plenty
of people right here in the USA who can do the job. It's up to
the tech firms themselves -- not taxpayers -- to find and train
them.

Tech firms: Visa cap a threat

The USA risks losing its competitive edge in technology, and jobs
will move offshore if the cap on foreign professionals working
here isn't lifted, three major tech companies said Wednesday.
Hundreds of new hires, waiting to transition from student visas,
will have to be fired. Texas Instruments will have to fire 100
making $ 45,000 to $ 80,000, Senior Vice President Stephen Leven
said in an interview after testifying before the Senate Judiciary
Committee. Also testifying were executives from Microsoft and
Sun Microsystems.
The annual cap on professionals, who must be college-educated,
has been 65,000 since 1990. Doctors, nurses and engineers are
among those working in this country under H-1B visas. But the
high-tech industry, which claims a shortage of 346,000 workers,
applies for 40% and has been the most vocal in support of a change.
The 65,000 H-1B visas, good for three years, account for 7% of
annual legal immigration.
The cap had not been a problem until last Sept. 5 when it was
reached for the first time with 25 days left in the fiscal year.
But this year the cap will be reached in May, perhaps April, says
Los Angeles immigration lawyer Carl Shusterman. As of last Friday,
the Immigration and Naturalization Service had received 35,747
applications for H-1B visas.
Labor unions oppose lifting the cap, saying tech companies are
exaggerating the labor shortage to import more workers and drive
down wages. Companies that become reliant on foreign workers will
lose their incentive to help improve the U.S. educational system
and retrain U.S. workers, says Steve Camarota of the Center for
Immigration Studies.
But Texas Instruments says foreigners it hires, mostly from Taiwan,
India and South Korea, are graduates of U.S. colleges. Because
there is a bidding war for their services, they are paid as much
as qualified U.S. citizens.
Two of the four founders of Sun Microsystems were from India and
Germany. The company has grown to employ 23,000, so foreign professionals
created thousands of jobs for U.S. citizens, says Vice President
Kenneth Alvares. Sun hired 4,788 people last year and presently
has 2,300 unfilled jobs, he says.
The Clinton administration indicated that it would support an
increase in the cap if companies can substantiate that U.S. workers
aren't being fired to make way for foreign workers.
